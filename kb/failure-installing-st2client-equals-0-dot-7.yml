  \ from https://pypi.python.org/packages/source/s/st2client/st2client-1.3.0.9.tar.gz#md5=3ed794a04bd839eae00b2a536ead913e\

  \ st2client\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs seen in the logs.\r\n\r\n## Cause\r\nsystem virtualenv\
  \ is too old and consequently included pip in the virtualenv is also too old.\r\n\
  \r\n## Fix by StackStorm\r\nSince issue was with installing st2client in a virtualenv\
  \ for one of the installer managed packs we managed to work-around with https://github.com/StackStorm/st2contrib/pull/367.\
  \ \r\n\r\nEssentially st2client is now picked up from the system provided python\
  \ packages as opposed to being installed from pypi.\r\n\r\n## Steps for users\r\n\
  * rm -rf /opt/stackstorm/packs/st2\r\n* Run `update-system`. \r\n\r\nOnce we merged\
  \ the above mentioned PR `st2` pack is now fixed."

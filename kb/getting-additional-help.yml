  \ few questions. Any of these questions you can answer up-front will speed our ability\
  \ to help you out.\r\n\r\n1. st2 version. (`st2 --version`)\r\n2. st2client version.\
  \ (`pip show st2client`)\r\n3. OS version. (Cent OS 7. `uname -a`)\r\n4. Python\
  \ version. (`python --version`)\r\n5. A brief description of the problem\r\n6. A\
  \ description of any troubleshooting that you have attempted.\r\n7. Any relevant\
  \ logs you have collected. \r\n  * Installer log is located at `/var/log/puppet.log`,\
  \ and StackStorm logs are typically in `/var/log/st2/`\r\n\r\nIf you are sure there\
  \ is a st2 bug after your research, file an issue at https://github.com/StackStorm/st2/issues/new\r\
  \n\r\nIf you are asked for installation logs, make sure to look through and validate\
  \ there is no sensitive data you do not want exposed, and sanitize. Then, scoop\
  \ it up and send it to us via one of our other contact methods\r\n\r\n_**NOTE**:\

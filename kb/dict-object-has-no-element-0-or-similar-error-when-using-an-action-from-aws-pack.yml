body: "Recently the actions in AWS pack have been updated and the result format has\
  \ changed. Previously some of the actions such as **ec2_run_instances** returned\
  \ a list of list of dictionaries and they have been updated to correctly return\
  \ a list of dictionaries (one level of unnecessary indirection has been removed).\r\
  \n\r\nIf you have recently updated or reinstalled the AWS pack and you have actions\
  \ / workflows which utilize those actions you will need to update them to take into\
  \ account the new result format.\r\n\r\nYou know you are affected if you receive\
  \ an error message similar to the one below when trying to run a workflow.\r\n\r\
  \n> ParameterRenderingFailedException: Failed rendering value for action parameter\
  \ \"instance_id\" in task \"wait_for_instance\" (template string={{run_instances.result[0][0].id}}):\
  \ dict object has no element 0\r\n\r\nThis error is taken from an action-chain workflow,\
  \ but you should receive a similar error message if you use Mistral workflows.\r\
  \n\r\nTo fix your workflow, simply update your variables / actions to remove the\
  \ second list access as shown below:\r\n\r\n **run_instances.result[0][0].id** ->\
  \ **run_instances.result[0].id**"

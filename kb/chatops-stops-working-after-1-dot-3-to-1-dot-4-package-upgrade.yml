body: "## Problem\r\n\r\nAfter a package-based install of StackStorm 1.3.* was upgraded\
  \ to 1.4, ChatOps and live refresh in Web UI stopped working.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\
  \n\r\nThe URL of the stream service that both ChatOps and Web UI rely upon was changed\
  \ in 1.4.\r\n\r\n1. Make sure you have nginx version 1.7.5 or above. Ubuntu users\
  \ might need to add the official nginx source list: http://nginx.org/en/linux_packages.html\r\
  \n2. Apply the new nginx config: `sudo cp /usr/share/doc/st2/conf/nginx/st2.conf\
  \ /etc/nginx/conf.d/`\r\n3. Update the ChatOps workflow in `/opt/stackstorm/packs/chatops/actions/workflows/post_result.yaml`\
  \ with the most recent version: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/StackStorm/st2/master/contrib/chatops/actions/workflows/post_result.yaml\r\
  \n4. Restart nginx.\r\n5. Restart StackStorm."

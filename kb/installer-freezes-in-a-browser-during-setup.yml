body: "Sometimes the graphical setup freezes in the browser while running the setup,\
  \ after all the answers are provided. While we're fixing the bug, the workaround\
  \ is:\r\n\r\n1. ssh to the box. At this point all the answers you provided to the\
  \ setup are already in answer file under `/opt/puppet/hieradata/answers.json`. \r\
  \n\r\n2. check if installer is still running\r\n```\r\nps axw | grep puppet\r\n\
  ```\r\n    If there's anything like `ruby /opt/puppet/...`, the installer is still\
  \ running; the setup is not frozen it's just being slow.\r\n\r\n3. if installer\
  \ is still running, wait for it to complete. Else, run `update-system`. It'll use\
  \ the answers.json and complete the installation.\r\n\r\n4. Go to https://yourhostpublicaddress/\
  \ and login with username/password you provided to the graphical setup."

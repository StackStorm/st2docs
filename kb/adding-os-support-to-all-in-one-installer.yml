body: "Hello, brave traveller! You are currently venturing to new and unknown lands,\
  \ and want to take StackStorm along on your voyage. Well, frankly, we're flattered!\
  \ But, sometimes we need some help getting geared up for new places, and could use\
  \ your help together the necessary items to run on your OS of choice.\r\n\r\n##\
  \ Suggested Reading\r\n\r\nhttps://stackstorm.reamaze.com/articles/installer-internals-and-flow\r\
  \n\r\nWhile not absolutely necessary, it is highly recommended to take a look at\
  \ the [Installer Internals and Flow](https://stackstorm.reamaze.com/articles/installer-internals-and-flow)\
  \ article. This shows at least the overview and goals of the Installer, and where\
  \ it is headed as well as we grow/learn/mature.\r\n\r\n## Things/places to add.\r\

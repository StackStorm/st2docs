body: "# Docker\r\n\r\nWithout a doubt, we get asked about official Docker support\
  \ quite often... and the answer is: _Today, we do not officially support Docker._\r\
  \n\r\nThe reason is many, but it boils down to this: We want to make sure that our\
  \ support for Docker is second to none.\r\n\r\nTo that end, along with helping new\
  \ users like yourself out, we're balancing features and support and fun. Never fear!\
  \ We actually have _BETA_ containers. They don't even have docs yet... just this\
  \ wonderful KB article. If you'd like to help us out and test things, please take\
  \ a look at this repo:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/StackStorm/st2-dockerfiles\r\n\r\
  \nPlease keep in mind, these are currently _NOT SUPPORTED_, so any official asks\
  \ in our support channels will be kindly reminded that we do not yet support Docker,\
  \ and it is at your own risk.\r\n\r\nFeedback is most assuredly accepted welcome,\
  \ in the form of both issues/comments as well as Pull Requests\r\n\r\nSee you amongst\
  \ the containers soon!\r\n"

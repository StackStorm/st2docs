body: "Here are the basic steps you need to perform for ChatOps troubleshooting. This\
  \ guide covers a clean 1.2.0+ install up to the point where Hubot should work, reply\
  \ to your commands and send manually triggered messages via `chatops.post_message`:\
  \ \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## New: self-check\r\n\r\nThere's a new self-check Bash script\
  \ in the `hubot-stackstorm` reposotory: [selfcheck.sh](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/StackStorm/hubot-stackstorm/master/selfcheck.sh).\
  \ It supports installations of StackStorm 1.2 and above (with Hubot set up inside\
  \ a Docker container), and runs a few essential tests along with giving you basic\
  \ troubleshooting steps on failure. \r\n\r\nThis article mostly just repeats the\
  \ script's steps, and we'll probably deprecate it once the script is mature enough,\
  \ but at this time you can still use it for reference.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Old:\
  \ manual steps\r\n\r\n#### Your bot is not online.\r\n\r\nYou've installed StackStorm,\
  \ but Hubot didn't come online.\r\n\r\n##### Possible reasons:\r\n1. You did not\
  \ run the installer UI at `https://<hostname>/setup`. \r\n2. ChatOps checkbox was\
  \ unchecked in the installer UI (it's checked by default though).\r\n3. You didn't\
  \ enter the correct token or login credentials (also see [some extra info for HipChat](https://stackstorm.reamaze.com/admin/articles/hubot-does-not-connect-to-hipchat/edit)).\
  \ \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n#### There's no StackStorm commands in `!help`\r\n\r\nHubot\
  \ is online, but when you say `!help`, only default commands are listed (no commands\
  \ starting with `st2`).\r\n\r\n##### Possible reasons:\r\n1. Hubot can't connect\
  \ to StackStorm API. Look in the Hubot logs for clues.\r\n2. Commands aren't registered.\
  \ Try `st2ctl reload --register-all`.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n#### StackStorm commands\
  \ throw errors\r\n\r\nHubot is online, you can see `st2` commands, but saying something\
  \ like `!st2 list actions` either throws an error, or gives an acknowledgement message\
  \ without result, or no response at all.\r\n\r\n##### Possible reasons:\r\n1. Hubot\
  \ is disconnected from StackStorm stream. Try `st2ctl reload --register-all` and\
  \ `service docker-hubot restart`.\r\n2. There's a back-end problem. Make sure other\
  \ parts of StackStorm are working properly.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n#### StackStorm commands\
  \ are fine but no manual messages\r\n\r\nYou can run StackStorm commands (and your\
  \ own aliases) via your bot, but you can't trigger `chatops.post_message` action\
  \ manually from CLI or Web UI.\r\n\r\n##### Possible reasons:\r\n1. Some of your\
  \ action parameters (route, channel, etc) are incorrect. Take a look at `chatops.post_result`\
  \ workflow execution from any chat command you issued before, and repeat every parameter\
  \ in `post_message` (the last step of the workflow) as is.\r\n\r\n---"

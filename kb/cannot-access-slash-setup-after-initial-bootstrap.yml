body: "# Problem\r\n\r\nAfter running the StackStorm All-in-One Installer, the `/setup`\
  \ endpoint to configure StackStorm is inaccessible.\r\n\r\n## Symptoms\r\n\r\nThis\
  \ problem usually manifests itself in a few ways. Namely:\r\n\r\n* Web browser is\
  \ unable to connect to server\r\n* StackStorm API server is not available\r\n* StackStorm\
  \ Installer is unable to install packs during initial installation.\r\n\r\nExample\
  \ Installer Failure:\r\n\r\n```\r\nNotice: /Stage[main]/St2::Packs/St2::Pack[hubot]/Exec[install-st2-pack-hubot]/returns:\
  \ 2015-11-17 12:32:47,948  WARNING - Auth API server is not available, skipping\
  \ authentication.\r\nNotice: /Stage[main]/St2::Packs/St2::Pack[hubot]/Exec[install-st2-pack-hubot]/returns:\
  \ ERROR: HTTPSConnectionPool(host='10.24.49.161', port=9101): Max retries exceeded\
  \ with url: /actions/packs.install (Caused by NewConnectionError('<requests.packages.urllib3.connection.VerifiedHTTPSConnection\
  \ object at 0x7f2cc0094110>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 111] Connection\
  \ refused',))\r\nError: st2 run packs.install packs=hubot    returned 1 instead\
  \ of one of [0]\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Suggested Fixes\r\n\r\nStep 1: Ensure the webserver\
  \ is running\r\n\r\n* On your machine, check to see if the `nginx` application is\
  \ running. If not, try starting the daemon manually.\r\n* If `nginx` throws a `Port\
  \ already in use` error, check to see what applications are using the ports needed\
  \ to start StackStorm\r\n  * Ports needed available are: TCP 80, 443, 9100, and\
  \ 9101\r\n* Try to access `/setup`\r\n\r\n\r\nStep 2: Ensure StackStorm services\
  \ are running\r\n\r\n* Check to see the status of StackStorm by running `st2ctl\
  \ status`. \r\n  * You may see that `st2web` is disabled. This is benign, as services\
  \ are being run via `nginx`\r\n* Restart the StackStorm services by running the\
  \ command `st2ctl restart`.\r\n* Try to access `/setup`\r\n\r\nStep 3: Ensure Network\
  \ is configured properly\r\n\r\nIn some cases, the installer is unable to properly\
  \ detect the right IP address to use when setting up the initial system, and tries\
  \ to bind to the `docker0` interface.\r\n\r\n* On your system, run `ifconfig` and\
  \ pick a network interface that is externally excessible. Make note of the interface\
  \ name. (e.g.: `eth0`)\r\n* **Open** the file /opt/puppet/hieradata/answers.yaml,\
  \ and add a new line to tell the installer what interface to use.\r\n  * If this\
  \ file does not exist, create it.\r\n\r\n```\r\n# For example, if eth0 was an exterally\
  \ excessible network adapter\r\n---\r\nsystem::ipaddress: %{::ipaddress_eth0}`\r\
  \n```\r\n\r\nOnce this is finished, re-run the StackStorm installation process by\
  \ running the command `update-system`"

title: Reset Password with Default (htpasswd) Authentication Backend
topic: General
body: |
    The default authentication backend for StackStorm is `htpasswd`. By default
    the `htpasswd` file path is `/etc/st2/htpasswd`. To reset the password you can
    follow the following steps.
     
    1. Log into the StackStorm server that has the auth service running.
    2. Change the password for the user account in question by running: `sudo htpasswd -b /etc/st2/htpasswd <username> <password>`
        
    For example if you would like to set `Ch@ngeMe` to the password for the user `st2admin` you would run the below command.
    `sudo htpasswd -b /etc/st2/htpasswd st2admin Ch@ngeMe`

body: "When you install a pack from a private repository, you have to supply access\
  \ credentials:\r\n\r\n```\r\nhttps://<login>:<password>@example.com/name/project.git\r\
  \n```\r\n\r\nHowever, exposing your login details in such a way can potentially\
  \ become a security issue. When using GitHub, it's advised to use access tokens\
  \ instead:\r\n\r\n1. Go to your private project's settings.\r\n2. Generate a new\
  \ token for the project.\r\n3. Use `https://<token>:x-oauth-basic@github.com/name/project.git`\
  \ as your repo address.\r\n\r\nThis way login details are not exposed, and you have\
  \ full control over your token: revoke it or change permissions at any time."

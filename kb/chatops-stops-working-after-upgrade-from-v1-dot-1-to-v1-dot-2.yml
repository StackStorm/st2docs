body: "# Symptoms\r\n\r\nAfter upgrading from StackStorm v1.1 to v1.2 using the all-in-one\
  \ installer, ChatOps messages no longer work and instead throw an error:\r\n\r\n\
  ```\r\n\"error\": \"Task \\\"get_execution\\\" failed: Additional properties are\
  \ not allowed ('exclude' was unexpected)\\n\\nFailed validating 'additionalProperties'\
  \ in schema:\\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `st2` pack needs to be updated to the latest version\
  \ to account for schema changes.\r\n\r\n# Resolution\r\n\r\nTo resolve, simply re-install\
  \ the `st2` pack. This can be done with the following command:\r\n\r\n* `st2 run\
  \ packs.install packs=st2`\r\n\r\nOnce completed, errors should cease and ChatOps\
  \ should continue working.\r\n"

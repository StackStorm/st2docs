Quick Start
=================

Got |st2| :doc:`installed </install/index>`? Let's take it for a spin.

This guide will walk you through |st2| basics and help you build and run a simple automation: a
rule that triggers an action on an external event.

Explore |st2| with CLI
----------------------

The best way to explore |st2| is to use the CLI. Start by running a few commands:

.. code-block:: bash

    st2 --version

    # Get help. It's a lot. Explore.
    st2 -h

    # Authenticate and export the token. Make sure ST2_AUTH_URL and
    # ST2_API_URL are set correctly (http vs https, endpoint, and etc).
    # Replace the username and password in the example below appropriately.
    export ST2_AUTH_TOKEN=`st2 auth -t -p 'Ch@ngeMe' st2admin`

    # List the actions from the 'core' pack
    st2 action list --pack=core
    st2 trigger list
    st2 rule list

    # Run a local shell command
    st2 run core.local -- date -R

    # See the execution results
    st2 execution list

    # Run a shell command on remote hosts. Requires passwordless SSH configured.
    st2 run core.remote hosts='localhost' -- uname -a

All |st2| operations are also available via REST API, Python, and JavaScript
bindings. Check the :doc:`CLI and Python Client </reference/cli>` reference for details.

You can also do a lot through the Web UI: Check the history, run actions, configure rules, install
packs...check it out at https://{YOUR_ST2_IP}. Login is the same as via the ``st2`` CLI. Default is
``st2admin``/``Ch@ngeMe``.

Authenticate
------------

You will almost certainly have authentication enabled. To easiest way to login via CLI is this:

.. code-block:: bash

    st2 login st2admin --password 'Ch@ngeMe'

This will obtain an authentication token, and cache it.

There are other options for authentication: check the :doc:`docs<authentication>` for more details.

Work with Actions
-----------------

|st2| comes with several generic actions out of the box. The catalog of actions can be easily
extended by getting actions from the community or consuming your existing scripts (more on that
later). 

Browse the catalog with ``st2 action list``. Actions are referred to by a ``ref``. This takes the
form ``pack.action_name`` (e.g. ``core.local``).

Learn about an action by running ``st2 action get <action>``, or ``st2 run <action> --help``. This
will give you the description, along with the action parameters. This tells you how to run it from
the CLI, or use it in rules and workflows.

.. code-block:: bash

    # List all the actions in the library
    st2 action list

    # Get action metadata
    st2 action get core.http

    # Display action details and parameters.
    st2 run core.http --help

To run an action from the CLI, use ``st2 run <action> key=value positional arguments``:

.. code-block:: bash

    # Run a local command
    st2 run core.local -- uname -a

    # HTTP REST call to st2 action endpoint
    st2 run -j core.http url="https://docs.stackstorm.com" method="GET"

Use the ``core.remote`` action to run Linux commands on multiple hosts via SSH. This assumes that
passwordless SSH access is configured for the hosts, as described in the
:ref:`config-configure-ssh` section.

.. code-block:: bash

    st2 run core.remote hosts='abc.example.com, cde.example.com' username='mysshuser' -- ls -l

.. note::

    For ``core.local`` and ``core.remote`` actions, we use ``--`` to separate action parameters
    to ensure that options keys, like ``-l`` or ``-a`` are properly passed to the action.
    Alternatively, ``core.local`` and ``core.remote`` actions take the ``cmd`` parameter to pass
    crazily complex commands.

    When specifying a command using the command line tool, you also need to escape all variables,
    otherwise the variables will get interpolated locally by a shell. Variables are escaped using
    a backslash (``\``) - e.g. ``\$user``.

.. code-block:: bash

    # Using `--` to separate arguments
    st2 run core.local -- ls -al

    # Equivalent using `cmd` parameter
    st2 run core.local cmd="ls -al"

    # Crazily complex command passed with `cmd`
    st2 run core.remote hosts='localhost' cmd="for u in bob phill luke; do echo \"Logins by \$u per day:\"; grep \$u /var/log/secure | grep opened | awk '{print \$1 \"-\" \$2}' | uniq -c | sort; done;"

Check the action execution history and details of action executions with the ``st2 execution``
command:

.. code-block:: bash

    # List of executions (most recent at the bottom)
    st2 execution list

    # Get execution by ID
    st2 execution get <execution_id>

    # Get only the last 5 executions
    st2 execution list -n 5

That's it. You have learned to run |st2|'s actions. Now let's stitch events and actions together
with rules.

Define a Rule
-------------

|st2| uses rules to run actions or workflows when events happen. Events are typically monitored
by sensors. When a sensor catches an event, it fires a trigger. Trigger trips the rule, the rule
checks the criteria and if it matches, it runs an action. Easy enough. Let’s look at an example.

Sample rule: :github_st2:`sample_rule_with_webhook.yaml
<contrib/examples/rules/sample_rule_with_webhook.yaml>` :

.. literalinclude:: /../../st2/contrib/examples/rules/sample_rule_with_webhook.yaml
    :language: yaml

The rule definition is a YAML file with three sections: trigger, criteria, and action. This
example is set up to react on a webhook trigger, and applies filtering criteria to the content of
the trigger.

The webhook in this example is setup to listen on the ``sample`` sub-url at
``https://{host}/api/v1/webhooks/sample``. When a POST is made to this URL, the trigger
fires. If the criteria matches (in this case the value in payload is ``st2``), the payload will be
appended to the file ``st2.webhook_sample.out`` in the home directory of |st2| system user. By default, this is ``stanley``, so the file will be located at
``/home/stanley/st2.webhook_sample.out``. See :doc:`rules` for detailed rule anatomy.

The trigger payload is referred to with ``{{trigger}}``. If the trigger payload is a valid JSON
object, it is parsed and can be accessed like ``{{trigger.path.to.parameter}}``
(it's `Jinja template syntax <http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/dev/templates/>`__).

What are the triggers available to use in rules? Just like with actions, use the CLI to browse
triggers, learn what the trigger does, how to configure it, and what the payload structure is:

.. code-block:: bash

    # List all available triggers
    st2 trigger list

    # Check details on Interval Timer trigger
    st2 trigger get core.st2.IntervalTimer

    # Check details on the Webhook trigger
    st2 trigger get core.st2.webhook

Deploy a Rule
-------------

|st2| can be configured to auto-load the rules or rules can be deployed with API or CLI:

.. code-block:: bash

    # Create the rule
    st2 rule create /usr/share/doc/st2/examples/rules/sample_rule_with_webhook.yaml

    # List the rules
    st2 rule list

    # List the rules for the examples pack
    st2 rule list --pack=examples

    # Get the rule that was just created
    st2 rule get examples.sample_rule_with_webhook

Once the rule is created, the webhook begins to listen on ``https://{host}/api/v1/webhooks/{url}``.
Fire the POST, check out the file and see that it appends the payload if the name=Joe.

.. code-block:: bash

    # Post to the webhook
    curl -k https://localhost/api/v1/webhooks/sample -d '{"foo": "bar", "name": "st2"}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'X-Auth-Token: put_token_here'

    # Check if the action was executed (this shows the last action)
    st2 execution list -n 1

    # Check that the rule worked. By default, st2 runs as the stanley user.
    sudo tail /home/stanley/st2.webhook_sample.out

    # And for fun, same post with st2
    st2 run core.http method=POST body='{"you": "too", "name": "st2"}' url=https://localhost/api/v1/webhooks/sample headers='x-auth-token=put_token_here,content-type=application/json' verify_ssl_cert=False

    # And for even more fun, using basic authentication over https
    st2 run core.http url=https://httpbin.org/basic-auth/st2/pwd username=st2 password=pwd

    # Check that the rule worked. By default, st2 runs as the stanley user.
    sudo tail /home/stanley/st2.webhook_sample.out

Congratulations, your first |st2| rule is up and running!

Deploy Examples
---------------

Examples of rules, custom sensors, actions, and workflows are installed with |st2| and located
at :github_st2:`/usr/share/doc/st2/examples <contrib/examples/>`. To deploy, copy them to 
``/opt/stackstorm/packs/``, setup, and reload the content:

.. code-block:: bash

    # Copy examples to st2 content directory
    sudo cp -r /usr/share/doc/st2/examples/ /opt/stackstorm/packs/

    # Run setup
    st2 run packs.setup_virtualenv packs=examples

    # Reload stackstorm context
    st2ctl reload --register-all

For more content — actions, sensors, rules — check out the `StackStorm Exchange
<https://exchange.stackstorm.org>`__.

Datastore
---------

While most data are retrieved as needed by |st2|, you may need to store and share some common
variables. Use the |st2| datastore service to store the values and reference them in rules and
workflows as ``{{st2kv.system.my_parameter}}``.

This creates ``user=stanley`` key-value pair:

.. code-block:: bash

    # Create a new key value pair
    st2 key set user stanley

    # List the key value pairs in the datastore
    st2 key list

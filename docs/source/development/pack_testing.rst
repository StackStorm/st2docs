Pack Testing
============

This section includes information on pack testing - where to put the tests,
how to write the tests, mock classes which can be used to make testing
easier, etc.

Test File Locations and Names
-----------------------------

All the test files should go into ``<pack name>/tests/`` directory. If tests
include any fixtures, they should be put in the ``<pack name>/tests/fixtures/``
directory.

Test files should follow the following naming conventions:

* ``test_action_<action name>.py`` for action tests. For example, if the action
  is named ``parse_xml``, the file should be named ``test_action_parse_xml.py``.
* ``test_sensor_<sensor name>.py`` for sensor tests. For example, if the sensor
  is named ``GithubEvents``, the file should be named ``test_sensor_github_events.py``.
* ``test_action_aliases.py`` for all the action aliases tests.

General Testing Conventions
---------------------------

Most of the |st2| packs interact with a third party API or tool. Writing full-blown integration
and end-to-end tests would be very time consuming and hard, so the convention is to write unit
tests and mock the responses and method calls where necessary.

Base Test Classes and Mock Classes
----------------------------------

To make testing easier, |st2| provides some base test and mock classes you can use in the tests.

Base Test Classes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* ``st2tests.base.BaseSensorTestCase`` - Base class for all the sensor test cases. This class
  provides utility methods for making sensor testing easier, such as returning a sensor class
  instance with ``sensor_service`` correctly populated, a method for asserting that trigger
  has been dispatched (``assertTriggerDispatched``) and more.
* ``st2tests.base.BaseActionTestCase`` - Base class for all the action test cases. This class
  provides utility methods for making action testing easier such as returning an action class
  with ``action_service`` correctly populated, etc.
* ``st2tests.BaseActionAliasTestCase`` - Base class for all the action aliases test cases. This
  class provides utility functions for testing the action alias.

Mock Classes
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* ``st2tests.mocks.runner.MockActionRunner`` - Mock action runner class which allows you to specify
  a mock status, result and context which is returned from the ``run`` method.
* ``st2tests.mocks.sensor.MockSensorWrapper`` - Mock ``SensorWrapper`` class.
* ``st2tests.mocks.sensor.MockSensorService`` - Mock ``SensorService`` class. This class mocks
  methods which operate on the datastore items (``get_logger``, ``list_values``, ``get_value``,
  ``set_value``, ``delete_value``).
* ``st2tests.mocks.action.MockActionWrapper`` - Mock ``PythonActionWrapper`` class.
* ``st2tests.mocks.action.MockActionService`` - Mock ``ActionService`` class. This class mocks
  methods which operate on the datastore items (``list_values``, ``get_value``, ``set_value``,
  ``delete_value``).

Dependencies
------------

In addition to the |st2| and pack dependencies listed in ``requirements.txt`` and
``requirements-tests.txt``, the following libraries are also available by default inside the tests:

* ``unittest2``
* ``mock``

The sensors (``<pack name>/sensors/``) and actions (``<pack name>/actions/``) directory is added
to PYTHONPATH meaning you can import sensor and action modules directly in your code.

For example, if you have an action file named ``actions/parse_xml.py`` you can do the following
inside your test module:

.. sourcecode:: python

    import parse_xml

Keep in mind that both sensor and action modules are not namespaced which means sensor and action
module names need to be unique to avoid conflicts.

Fixtures
--------

All the fixture data such as raw HTTP responses and similar, should be stored in files in the
``<pack path>/tests/fixtures`` directory (e.g. ``libcloud/tests/fixtures/list_zones.json``).

To retrieve raw content of the fixture file you can use the ``get_fixture_content`` method
available on the test class.

Instantiating and obtaining class instances
-------------------------------------------

When obtaining a sensor or an action class instance you should use ``get_sensor_instance`` and
``get_action_instance`` methods provided on the base test class instead of directly instantiating
the sensor/action class yourself.

This is important because those two methods mimic the class initialization process which is
otherwise performed inside the action/sensor wrapper.

Sensor tests:

.. sourcecode:: python

    class MySensorSensorTestCase(BaseSensorTestCase):
        sensor_cls = MySensor

        def test_method(self):
            sensor = self.get_sensor_instance(config={'foo': 'bar'})
            sensor.poll()
            # ...


Action tests:

.. sourcecode:: python

    class MyActionActionTestCase(BaseActionTestCase):
        action_cls = MyAction

        def test_method(self):
            action = self.get_action_instance(config={'foo': 'bar'})
            result = action.run()
            # ...

Action alias tests:

.. sourcecode:: python

    class MyActionAliasTestCase(BaseActionTestCase):
        action_alias_name = 'my_alias'

        def test_method(self):
            action_alias_db = self.action_alias_db

As you can see, when testing aliases you need to specify the name of the alias which is to be
tested. This alias is automatically retrieved from disk and available via ``self.action_alias_db``
instance variable.

Sample Tests
------------

Here's some example tests:

* Sensor - `test_sensor_docker_sensor <https://github.com/StackStorm-Exchange/stackstorm-docker/blob/master/tests/test_sensor_docker_sensor.py>`_
* Action - `test_action_parse <https://github.com/StackStorm-Exchange/stackstorm-csv/blob/master/tests/test_action_parse.py>`_
* Action Aliases - `test_action_aliases <https://github.com/StackStorm/st2/blob/master/contrib/packs/tests/test_action_aliases.py>`_

Running Tests
-------------

.. note::

  For this script to work correctly, all the StackStorm components need to be
  in ``PYTHONPATH``. This is already the case when using ``st2vagrant``
  Vagrant image or when StackStorm is installed on a system using deb/rpm
  packages.

  If that is not the case, you need to set ``ST2_REPO_PATH`` environment
  variable to point to the git checkout of the StackStorm st2 repository as
  shown below:

  .. sourcecode:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/StackStorm/st2.git /tmp/st2
    ST2_REPO_PATH=/tmp/st2 st2-run-pack-tests -p <pack path>

To run all the tests in a particular pack you can use the ``st2-run-pack-tests`` script
(``st2common/bin/st2-run-pack-tests``) from the ``st2`` repository:

.. sourcecode:: bash

  st2-run-pack-tests -p <pack path>

For example:

.. sourcecode:: bash

  st2-run-pack-tests -p /data/packs/docker/

By default, this script will create and use a new temporary virtual environment for each pack test
run and install all the dependencies which are required to run the tests inside this virtual
environment.

If you want to avoid virtual environment creation (e.g. the virtual environment already exists or
you have created one manually), you can pass the ``-x`` flag to the script. This flag will tell it
to skip virtual environment creation, but all the necessary dependencies will still be installed.

If you are running this script inside a development VM (st2vagrant), you can safely pass the ``-x``
flag to the script since a virtual environment should already be created and all the necessary
|st2| dependencies should be available in ``PYTHONPATH``.

In addition to that, if all the pack dependencies are already installed and you want to skip
installing and updating the dependencies, you can pass the ``-j`` flag to the script (this will
cause the script to just run the pack tests directly):

For example:

.. sourcecode:: bash

    st2-run-pack-tests -p /data/packs/docker/ -x -j

Alternatively, if a virtual environment for tests has already been created during previous tool
invocation, you can skip updating of the virtual environment and just run the tests by using the
``-j`` flag (this will speed things up because the virtual environment will be used as-is and only
tests will run):

.. sourcecode:: bash

    # First run - create tests virtual environment and run the tests
    st2-run-pack-tests -p /data/packs/docker/

    # Second (and subsequent) runs - just run the tests and re-use the existing
    # virtual environment which has been created during the previous script
    # invocation.
    st2-run-pack-tests -p /data/packs/docker/ -j

As more tests are developed it is always a good idea to determine how much code has been covered by
the tests and how much remains un-tested. Calculated test coverage can be printed out using the
``-c`` option.

.. sourcecode:: bash

     st2-run-pack-tests -c -p /data/packs/docker/

The command will print out test coverage to ``stdout`` along with generating a coverage report in
``cover/index.html``.  This can be opened with any modern browser. The directory ``cover`` will be
created in the current working directory when the command ``st2-run-pack-tests`` is invoked.

Understanding how long a test takes to run is sometimes important. Timing metrics can be enabled
via the ``-t`` option.

.. sourcecode:: bash

     st2-run-pack-tests -t -p /data/packs/docker/


Lint Tools and Scripts
----------------------

In addition to tests, the `st2sdk`_ repository and package also ships with various other tools
and lint scripts which allow you to catch common errors and typos automatically and early.

For more information on those scripts and how to use them, please refer to the README in the
`st2sdk`_ repository.

Continuous Integration
----------------------

By default, the lint scripts mentioned above and tests for all the packs run
on every commit to ``st2`` and ``StackStorm-Exchange``.

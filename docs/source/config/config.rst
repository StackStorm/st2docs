Nginx and WSGI
--------------

Production |st2| installations use `nginx <http://nginx.org/en/>`_ for SSL termination,
serving static content of WebUI,
and running st2auth and st2api as WSGI apps via gunicorn/uwsgi. StackStorm nginx configurations
can be found at ``/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/st2*.conf``.


``st2auth`` and ``st2api`` can also run in by a built-in simple Python server. This is used for development and strongly discouraged for any production. Be aware that some settings in /etc/st2.conf are only effective when running in development mode, and don't apply when running under WSGI servers. Refer to the comments in
:github_st2:`st2.conf.sample <conf/st2.conf.sample>`.

Configure MongoDB
-----------------

StackStorm requires a connection to MongoDB to operate.


In :github_st2:`/etc/st2/st2.conf <conf/st2.prod.conf>` include the following section :

.. code-block:: bash

    [database]
    host = <MongoDB host>
    port = <MongoDB server port>
    db_name = <User define database name, usually st2>
    username = <username for db login>
    password = <password for db login>

The ``username`` and ``password`` properties are optional.

Configure RabbitMQ
------------------

StackStorm uses RabbitMQ for messaging between its services.

In :github_st2:`/etc/st2/st2.conf <conf/st2.prod.conf>` include the following section :

.. code-block:: bash

    [messaging]
    url = <amqp://#RMQ_USER:#RMQ_PASSWD@#RMQ_HOST:#RMQ_PORT/#RMQ_VHOST>

The ``#RMQ_VHOST`` property is optional and can be left blank.

StackStorm also supports `RabbitMQ cluster <https://www.rabbitmq.com/clustering.html>`_.

In :github_st2:`/etc/st2/st2.conf <conf/st2.prod.conf>` include the following section :

.. code-block:: bash

    [messaging]
    cluster_urls = <amqp://#RMQ_USER:#RMQ_PASSWD@#RMQ_NODE_1:#RMQ_PORT/#RMQ_VHOST>,
                   <amqp://#RMQ_USER:#RMQ_PASSWD@#RMQ_NODE_2:#RMQ_PORT/#RMQ_VHOST>,
                   <amqp://#RMQ_USER:#RMQ_PASSWD@#RMQ_NODE_3:#RMQ_PORT/#RMQ_VHOST>

Configure SSH
-------------

To run actions on remote hosts, |st2| uses SSH. It is advised to configure identity file based SSH access on all remote hosts.

|st2| ssh user and a path to SSH key are set in ``/etc/st2/st2.conf``. During installation, ``st2_deploy.sh`` script configures ssh on the local box for a user `stanley`.

Follow these steps on a remote box to setup `stanley` user on remote boxes. You will need elevated privileges (root) to do this.

.. code-block:: bash

    useradd stanley
    mkdir -p /home/stanley/.ssh
    chmod 0700 /home/stanley/.ssh

    # generate ssh keys on StackStorm box and copy over public key into remote box.
    ssh-keygen -f /home/stanley/.ssh/stanley_rsa -P ""
    cp ${KEY_LOCATION}/stanley_rsa.pub /home/stanley/.ssh/stanley_rsa.pub

    # authorize key-base acces.
    cat /home/stanley/.ssh/stanley_rsa.pub >> /home/stanley/.ssh/authorized_keys
    chmod 0600 /home/stanley/.ssh/authorized_keys
    chown -R stanley:stanley /home/stanley
    echo "stanley    ALL=(ALL)       NOPASSWD: SETENV: ALL" >> /etc/sudoers.d/st2
    chmod 0440 /etc/sudoers.d/st2

    # ensure requiretty is not set to default in the /etc/sudoers file.

To verify do the following from the |st2| box

.. code-block:: bash

    # ssh should not require a password since the key is already provided
    ssh -i /home/stanley/.ssh/stanley_rsa stanely@host.example.com

    # make sure that no password is prompted.
    sudo su

SSH Troubleshooting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Validate that passwordless SSH configuration works fine for the destination. Assuming default user `stanley`:

    .. code-block:: bash

        sudo ssh -i /home/stanley/.ssh/stanley_rsa -t stanley@host.example.com uname -a

Using SSH config
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

StackStorm allows loading of the SSH config file local to the system user. This is a configurable option and to
enable add following to ``/etc/st2/st2.conf``

.. code-block:: bash

    [ssh_runner]
    use_ssh_config = True
    ...

SUDO Access
-----------

StackStorm's ``shell`` actions -  ``local-shell-cmd``, ``local-shell-script``, ``remote-shell-cmd``, ``remote-shell-script``- are performed by a special user. By default, this user is named ``stanley`` and that is configurable via :github_st2:`st2.conf <conf/st2.prod.conf>`.

.. note:: `stanley` user requires the following access:

    * Sudo access to all boxes on which script action will run.
    * SETENV option needs to be set for all the commands. This way environment variables which are
      available to the local runner actions will also be available when user executes local runner
      action under a different user or with root privileges.
    * As some actions require sudo privileges password-less sudo access to all boxes.

One way of setting up passwordless sudo is perform the below operation on each remote box.

.. code-block:: bash

    echo "stanley    ALL=(ALL)       NOPASSWD: SETENV: ALL" >> /etc/sudoers.d/st2


Configure Logging
-----------------

By default, the logs can be found in ``/var/log/st2``.

* With the standard logging setup you will notice files like ``st2*.log`` and
  ``st2*.audit.log`` in the log folder.

* Per component logging configuration can be found in ``/etc/st2*/logging.conf``.
  Those files use `Python logging configuration format <https://docs.python.org/2/library/logging.config.html#configuration-file-format>`_.
  If you desire to change location of the log files, the paths and other
  settings can be modified in these files.

* By default, log rotation is handled via logrotate. Default log rotation config
  (:github_st2:`logrotate.conf <conf/logrotate.conf>`) is included with all the
  package based installations. Note that ``handlers.RotatingFileHandler`` is used by
  default in ``/etc/st2*/logging.conf``, but the ``maxBytes`` and ``backupCount`` args are not
  specififed so no rotation is performed by default which then lets logrotate handle the rotation.
  If you want Python services instead of logrotate to handle the log rotation for you, you can
  update the logging configs as shown below:

  .. code-block:: ini

      [handler_fileHandler]
      class=handlers.RotatingFileHandler
      level=DEBUG
      formatter=verboseConsoleFormatter
      args=("logs/st2api.log", "a", 100000000, 5)

  In this case the log file will be rotated when it reaches 100000000 bytes (100
  MB) and a maximum of 5 old log files will be kept. For more information, see
  `RotatingFileHandler <https://docs.python.org/2/library/logging.handlers.html#rotatingfilehandler>`_
  docs.

* Sensors run in their own process so it is recommended to not allow sensors to share the same
  ``RotatingFileHandler``. To configure a seperate handler per sensor
  ``/etc/st2reactor/logging.sensorcontainer.conf`` can be updated as follows where ``MySensor`` is
  the sensor in the ``mypack`` pack that will have its own log file:

  .. code-block:: ini

      [loggers]
      keys=root,MySensor

      [handlers]
      keys=consoleHandler, fileHandler, auditHandler, MySensorFileHandler, MySensorAuditHandler

      [logger_MySensor]
      level=INFO
      handlers=consoleHandler, MySensorFileHandler, MySensorAuditHandler
      propagate=0
      qualname=st2.SensorWrapper.mypack.MySensor

      [handler_MySensorFileHandler]
      class=handlers.RotatingFileHandler
      level=INFO
      formatter=verboseConsoleFormatter
      args=("logs/mysensor.log",)

      [handler_vSphereEventSensorAuditHandler]
      class=handlers.RotatingFileHandler
      level=AUDIT
      formatter=gelfFormatter
      args=("logs/mysensor.audit.log",)

* To configure logging with syslog, grab the configuration and follow
  instructions at :github_contrib:`st2contrib/extra/syslog <extra/syslog>`

* Check out LogStash configuration and Kibana dashboard for pretty logging and
  audit at :github_contrib:`st2contrib/extra/logstash <extra/logstash>`

Configure Mistral
-----------------
There are a number of configurable options available under the mistral section in ``/etc/st2/st2.conf``. If the mistral section is not provided, default values will be used. By default, all Keystone related options are unset and |st2| will not pass any credential for authentication to Mistral. Please refer to OpenStack and Mistral documentation for Keystone setup.

    # Example with basic options. The v2_base_url is set to http://workflow.example.com:8989/v2.
    # On connection error, the following configuration sets up the action runner to retry 
    # connecting to mistral for up to 10 minutes. The retries is setup to be exponential for

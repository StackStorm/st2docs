Mistral
=======

.. note::

    Our new workflow engine :doc:`Orquesta <orquesta/index>` is now GA. We recommend writing all new
    workflows in Orquesta. Mistral is still supported, but will be removed in a future release.

`Mistral <https://docs.openstack.org/mistral/latest/user/overview.html>`_ is an OpenStack project that
manages and executes workflows as a service. Mistral is automatically installed as a separate
service named "mistral" along with |st2|. A Mistral workflow can be defined as a |st2| action in a
Mistral workbook using the `v2 Workflow Language <https://docs.openstack.org/mistral/latest/user/wf_lang_v2.html>`_.

Expression languages such as YAQL are used for formatting variables and condition evaluations.
Starting with |st2| v2.2, Jinja2 is also supported where YAQL expressions are accepted. Both
workbook and workflow definitions are supported. 

On action execution, |st2| writes the definition to Mistral and executes the workflow. A workflow
can invoke other |st2| actions natively as subtasks. |st2| handles the translations and calls
transparently in Mistral and actively polls Mistral for execution results. |st2| actions in the
workflow can be traced back to the original parent action that invoked the workflow.

Basic Workflow
--------------

Similarly to ActionChains, Mistral workflows have an action metadata file in
``/opt/stackstorm/packs/<mypack>/actions``, and the workflow definition itself in
``/opt/stackstorm/packs/<mypack>/actions/workflows``.

Let's start with a very basic workflow that calls a |st2| action and notifies |st2| when the
workflow is done. The files used in this example are also located under
:github_st2:`/usr/share/doc/st2/examples <contrib/examples>` if |st2| is already installed (see
also :ref:`deploy examples <start-deploy-examples>`).

The first task is named ``run-cmd``. It executes a shell command on the server where |st2| is
installed. A task can reference any registered |st2| action directly. In this example, the
``run-cmd`` task calls ``core.local`` and passing the cmd as input. ``core.local`` is an action
that comes installed with |st2|. When the workflow is invoked, |st2| will translate the workflow
definition appropriately before sending it to Mistral. Let's save this as
``/opt/stackstorm/packs/examples/actions/workflows/mistral-basic.yaml`` on our |st2| server.

.. literalinclude:: /../../st2/contrib/examples/actions/workflows/mistral-basic.yaml
   :language: yaml

This is the corresponding |st2| action metadata for the example above. The |st2| pack for this
workflow action is named "examples". Note that the workflow is named fully qualified as
``<pack>.<action>`` in the definition above. The |st2| action runner is ``mistral-v2``. The entry
point for the |st2| action refers to the YAML file of the workflow definition. Let's save this
metadata as ``/opt/stackstorm/packs/examples/actions/mistral-basic.yaml``:

.. literalinclude:: /../../st2/contrib/examples/actions/mistral-basic.yaml
   :language: yaml

The following table list optional parameters that can be defined in the workflow action. In the
example, these optional parameters are set to immutable. It is good practice to set them to
immutable even if they are empty since these are Mistral-specific parameters for the workflow
author.

+------------+--------------------------------------------------------+
| options    | description                                            |
+============+========================================================+
| workflow   | If definition is a workbook containing many workflows, |
|            | this specifies the main workflow to execute.           |
+------------+--------------------------------------------------------+
| task       | If the type of workflow is "reverse", this specifies   |
|            | the task to invoke.                                    |
+------------+--------------------------------------------------------+
| context    | A dictionary containing additional workflow start up   |
|            | parameters.                                            |
+------------+--------------------------------------------------------+

Next, run ``st2 action create /opt/stackstorm/packs/examples/actions/mistral-basic.yaml`` to
create this workflow action. This will register the workflow as ``examples.mistral-basic`` in
|st2|. To execute the workflow, run ``st2 run examples.mistral-basic cmd=date -a`` where ``-a``
tells the command to return and not wait for the workflow to complete. 

If the workflow completed successfully, both the workflow ``examples.mistral-basic`` and the
action ``core.local`` should have a ``succeeded`` status in the |st2| action execution list. By
default, ``st2 execution list`` only returns top level executions. This means subtasks are not
displayed.

.. code-block:: shell

    +--------------------------+--------------+--------------+-----------+-----------------+---------------+
    | id                       | action.ref   | context.user | status    | start_timestamp | end_timestamp |
    +--------------------------+--------------+--------------+-----------+-----------------+---------------+
    | 54ee54c61e2e24152b769a47 | examples     | stanley      | succeeded | Wed, 25 Feb     | Wed, 25 Feb   |
    |                          | .mistral-    |              |           | 2015 23:03:34   | 2015 23:03:34 |
    |                          | basic        |              |           | UTC             | UTC           |
    +--------------------------+--------------+--------------+-----------+-----------------+---------------+

To display subtasks, run ``st2 execution get <execution-id> --show-tasks``:

.. code-block:: shell

    +--------------------------+------------+--------------+-----------+------------------------------+------------------------------+
    | id                       | action.ref | context.user | status    | start_timestamp              | end_timestamp                |
    +--------------------------+------------+--------------+-----------+------------------------------+------------------------------+
    | 54ee54c91e2e24152b769a49 | core.local | stanley      | succeeded | Wed, 25 Feb 2015 23:03:37    | Wed, 25 Feb 2015 23:03:37    |
    |                          |            |              |           | UTC                          | UTC                          |
    +--------------------------+------------+--------------+-----------+------------------------------+------------------------------+

The following is a simple extension of the previous workflow definition. In this example, we have
a second task named "task2". It might be natural to think that "task2" will be executed after
"task1", i.e, in sequential order. However, when no tasks attributes like ``on-complete``,
``on-success`` and ``on-error`` are defined, tasks are run in parallel. This is possible with
Mistral because it provides a join flow control which allows us to synchronize multiple parallel
workflow branches and aggregate their data.

.. literalinclude:: /../../st2/contrib/examples/actions/workflows/mistral-basic-two-tasks-with-notifications.yaml
   :language: yaml

Publishing Variables
--------------------

A Mistral task can publish results from a task as variables that can be consumed in other tasks:

.. sourcecode:: yaml

    tasks:
        get_hostname:
            action: core.local
            input:
                cmd: "hostname"
            publish:
                hostname: <% task(get_hostname).result.stdout %>

In the above example, ``get_hostname`` is a ``core.local`` action which runs the command
``hostname``. The ``core.local`` action produces output consisting of the fields ``stdout``,
``stderr``, ``exit_code`` etc.

We just want to publish the variable ``stdout`` from it, for the rest of tasks to consume. To
reference the result of the task, use the ``task`` function, which returns a dictionary containing
attributes for the task such as id, state, result, and additional info.

Another example is shown below:

.. sourcecode:: yaml

    tasks:
        create_new_node:
            action: rackspace.create_vm
            input:
              name: <% $.hostname %>
              flavor_id: <% $.vm_size_id %>
              image_id: <% $.vm_image_id %>
              key_material: <% $.ssh_pub_key %>
              metadata:
                asg: <% $.asg %>
            publish:
              ipv4_address: '<% task(create_new_node).result.result.public_ips[1] %>'
              ipv6_address: '<% task(create_new_node).result.result.public_ips[0] %>'

In the above example, the action ``rackspace.create_vm`` is a Python action that produces a result
object. We just want to publish the IP addresses from the ``public_ips`` list field from the
result object.

Please note that ``result.result`` is not a typo. The Python action posts output to a key named
``result`` for the st2 action execution and the Mistral task function puts the result of the Python
action in ``result`` of its output dictionary.

Such published variables are accessible as input parameters to other tasks in the workflow. An
example of using ``ipv4_address`` from the above example in another task is shown below:

.. sourcecode:: yaml

    tasks:
        # ... <snap>

        setup_ipv4_dns:
            action: rackspace.create_dns_record
            wait-before: 1 # delay, in seconds
            input:
              name: '<% $.hostname %>.<% $.asg %>.<% $.domain %>'
              zone_id: <% $.dns_zone_id %>
              type: 'A'
              data: <% $.ipv4_address %>

        # .... </snap>

Stitching Together a More Complex Workflow
------------------------------------------

The following is a mock up of a more complex workflow. In this mock up running simple ``printf``
and ``sleep`` commands, the workflow demonstrates nested workflows, fork, and join:

.. literalinclude:: /../../st2/contrib/examples/actions/workflows/mistral-workbook-complex.yaml
   :language: yaml

Since there are multiple workflows defined in this workbook, the workflow author has to specify which workflow to execute in the metadata:

.. literalinclude:: /../../st2/contrib/examples/actions/mistral-workbook-complex.yaml
   :language: yaml

To test out this workflow, save the metadata file to ``/opt/stackstorm/packs/examples/actions/``
and the workflow file to ``/opt/stackstorm/packs/examples/actions/workflows``. Run
``st2 action create /opt/stackstorm/packs/examples/actions/mistral-workbook-complex.yaml`` to
create the action and run ``st2 run examples.mistral-workbook-complex vm_name="vmtest1" -a`` to
test.

Validation
----------

The Mistral CLI includes tools for performing high-level sanity checks of Mistral workflow YAML
files:

.. code-block:: bash

   # Validate a workflow
   mistral workflow-validate /path/to/workflow.yaml

   # Validate a workbook
   mistral workbook-validate /path/to/workbook.yaml


.. note::

   These sanity checks simply provide a test against the Mistral DSL schema. They do NOT test YAQL
   or Jinja2 expressions.


More Examples
-------------

There are more workflow examples under :github_st2:`/usr/share/doc/st2/examples <contrib/examples/actions/workflows/>`. These include error handling, repeat, and retries.

Installing Packs with ChatOps
-----------------------------

When you have the bot listening for ChatOps commands in a channel, installing extra packs from
|st2| Exchange can be done with a single command:

.. code-block:: bash

    !pack install github,slack,trello
    bot: Installing the requested pack(s) for you.
    @my_user:
    > Successful deployment of *github*, *slack*, *trello* packs!

You can install a pack from any GitHub repository just as easily: supply the full URL to the bot.
The pack name is unnecessary, as it will be read from ``pack.yaml`` later:

.. code-block:: bash

    !pack install https://github.com/stackstorm/openstack
    bot: Installing the requested pack(s) for you.

You can even mix the two formats in one string:

.. code-block:: bash

    !pack install github,slack,trello,https://github.com/stackstorm/openstack

Getting Information About an Installed Pack
-------------------------------------------

The ``!pack get <pack>`` command shows you information about an installed pack. There are two
sections in the output: the first is pack metadata from ``pack.yaml``, and the optional second is
git information, if your pack has been installed from a git source like StackStorm Exchange or a
single repo.

Git status will tell you if there's a difference between your local pack version and the latest
version in the origin repository, and also show the remotes for your pack.

If a pack is not installed, but available in |st2| Exchange, the bot will gallantly offer to
install it:

Getting Information About an Available Pack
-------------------------------------------

The remote counterpart to ``pack get`` is ``pack show``: it will show an entry from the StackStorm
Exchange, our pack directory, if a pack with the given name is available.

Searching for a Pack
--------------------

To search for a pack in StackStorm Exchange, use ``!pack search <query>``. Note that your query
will match results in all pack parameters: for example, you can search for an author or a keyword,
not just name and description. The results are ordered by relevance: if you search for "cloud",
first you will get packs with "cloud" in their name â€” because they are the most likely to be what
you were looking for - and then packs with "cloud" in keywords or description. And then packs
authored by "Mr. Cloud", if any.

**Pro-tip:** if you configure an additional pack index (see "Working with pack indexes" in
:doc:`/packs`), it will be queried alongside StackStorm Exchange by commands like ``show`` or
``search``.

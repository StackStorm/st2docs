Traces
======

Traces are tracking entities that serve to gather all |st2| entities like ActionExecution,
TriggerInstance and Rule that originate from an event. In the |st2| context an event could be one
of the following:

* Events from an external system sent to |st2| via a Sensor or Webhook.
* Action executed via UI, CLI or API.
* Action executed via ChatOps.

Examples
--------

Let's walk through a few canonical examples:

External events
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Sensors dispatch TriggerInstances into |st2| and Webhooks are also translated to TriggerInstances
when posted to |st2|. Rules are written to match specific Triggers and compared against
TriggerInstances.

In the canonical case, a TriggerInstance ``ti1`` is dispatched by Sensor to |st2|, matches a Rule
``r1`` leading to an ActionExecution ``ae1``. On completion of ``ae1`` an ActionTrigger
TriggerInstance ``ti2`` is dispatched by |st2|.

The trace created in this case contains all the entities from above, since they originate from the
same event i.e. TriggerInstance ``ti1``.

.. code-block:: bash

   Trace
     |- ti1
     |- r1
     |- ae1
     |- ti2

Connected Flows
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

|st2| raises an internal Trigger called the ActionTrigger. Rules can be used in conjunction with
those, on completion of executions.

An ActionExecution ``ae1`` is started by a user. On completion of ``ae1`` an ActionTrigger
TriggerInstance ``ti1`` is dispatched. Rule ``r1`` matches it, and leads to ActionExecution
``ae2``. Another ActionTrigger TriggerInstance ``ti2`` is dispatched but no rule is matched.

The trace created in this case contains all the entities from above since they cascade from the
same origin i.e. ActionExecution ``ae1``.

.. code-block:: bash

   Trace
     |- ae1
     |- ti1
     |- r1
     |- ae2
     |- ti2


Tracing Triggers and Executions
-------------------------------

Users can define their own identifying information for a Trace at event injection points. The
injection points for |st2| where a Trace can start are:

* Dispatch a Trigger (more precisely this is dispatching a TriggerInstance) by a Sensor.
* Webhook posted to |st2|.
* Execute an Action (aka creation of an ActionExecution) via UI, CLI, API or Chat.

What is trace_tag and trace_id?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* ``trace-tag``: User specified and therefore friendly way to tag or identify a Trace. There is no
  requirement for this value to be unique, and |st2| will not enforce this. Whenever only a
  ``trace-tag`` is provided at one of the injection points a new Trace is started if one does not
  already exist.

* ``trace-id``: This is a |st2|-defined value and is guaranteed to be unique. Users can specify
  this value at the injection points as well, but a Trace with the specified trace-id must already
  exist.

Dispatch a Trigger
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

TriggerInstance dispatch usually happens from a Sensor. The :ref:`authoring a
sensor<ref-sensors-authoring-a-sensor>` page contains information on how to introduce a Trace.

A brief snippet is included here to explain some trace-specific constructs. A sensor would inject
such triggers by using the ``sensor_service`` passed into the sensor on instantiation:

.. code-block:: python

    self.sensor_service.dispatch(trigger=trigger, payload=payload, trace_tag=trace_tag)


Here the Sensor is expected to supply a meaningful value for ``trace_tag`` e.g.:

* Commit SHA of a git commit for a git commit hook trigger.
* ID of the event from a monitoring system, e.g. Sensu or Nagios.

Webhook
^^^^^^^

Both custom webhooks and generic |st2| webhooks support supplying a trace-tag via the optional
header ``St2-Trace-Tag``.

For a custom webhook, the equivalent ``curl`` command is:

.. sourcecode:: bash

    curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:9101/v1/webhooks/sample -H "X-Auth-Token: matoken" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "St2-Trace-Tag: webhook-1" --data '{"key1": "value1"}'

Execute an Action
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Execution of an Action can also be associated with a Trace. Here's how to do that via CLI:

* To start a new trace use ``trace-tag``:

  .. code-block:: bash

    $ st2 run core.local date --trace-tag TraceDateAction


* To associate with an existing trace use ``trace-id``:

  .. code-block:: bash

    $ st2 run core.local uname --trace-id 55d505fd32ed35711522c4c8


Viewing Traces
--------------

|st2| CLI provides the ability to list and get traces.


List
^^^^

* All traces in the system:

  .. code-block:: bash

    $ st2 trace list


* Filter by trace-id:

  .. code-block:: bash

    $ st2 trace list --trace-tag <trace-tag>

* Filter by execution:

  .. code-block:: bash

    $ st2 trace list --execution 55d505fd32ed35711522c4c7

* Filter by rule:

  .. code-block:: bash

    $ st2 trace list --rule 55d5064432ed35711522c4ca

* Filter by trigger-instance:

  .. code-block:: bash

    $ st2 trace list --trigger-instance 55d5069832ed35711cc4b08e


Get
^^^

* Get a specific trace:

  .. code-block:: bash

    $ st2 trace get <trace-id>

* View the causation chain in a trace for an action execution. Similarly for rule and
  trigger-instance:

  .. code-block:: bash

    $ st2 trace get <trace-id> -e

* View specific type in a trace:

  .. code-block:: bash

    $ st2 trace get <trace-id> --show-executions

* Hide no-op trigger instances. These are trigger instances which do not lead to a rule
  enforcement:

  .. code-block:: bash

    $ st2 trace get <trace-id> --hide-noop-triggers


Is Everything Traced?
---------------------

By default all ActionExecutions and TriggerInstances are traced. If no ``trace-tag`` is provided by
a user then |st2| automatically generate a ``trace-tag`` to provide tracking.

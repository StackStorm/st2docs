Policies
========

Policies allows users to enforce different rules regarding action executions.

To list the types of policy that are available, run: ``st2 policy-type list``.

Policy configuration files should be stored in the ``policies`` folder in their respective packs,
similar to actions and rules. Policies can be loaded into |st2| via
``st2ctl reload --register-policies``. Once policies are loaded into |st2|, run the command
``st2 policy list`` to view the list of policies in effect.

Concurrency
-----------

The concurrency policy enforces the number of executions that can run simultaneously for a
specified action.

By default when a threshold is reached, action execution is delayed until the number of 
concurrent executions of a particular actions falls below the threshold. As an alternative, users
can specify that new executions are canceled, rather than delayed. 

There are two forms of concurrency policy: ``action.concurrency`` and ``action.concurrency.attr``.

action.concurrency
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``action.concurrency`` policy limits the concurrent executions for the action. The following
is an example of a policy file with concurrency defined for ``demo.my_action``. Please note that
the ``resource_ref`` and ``policy_type`` are the fully qualified name for the action and policy
type respectively. The ``threshold`` parameter defines how many concurrent instances are allowed.

In this example, no more than 10 instances of ``demo.my_action`` can be run simultaneously. Any
execution requests above this threshold will be postponed.

.. code-block:: yaml

    name: my_action.concurrency
    description: Limits the concurrent executions for my action.
    enabled: true
    resource_ref: demo.my_action
    policy_type: action.concurrency
    parameters:
        action: delay
        threshold: 10

If you want further actions to be canceled instead of delayed, ``action`` attribute should be
changed to ``cancel`` as shown below.

.. code-block:: yaml
   :emphasize-lines: 7

    name: my_action.concurrency
    description: Limits the concurrent executions for my action.
    enabled: true
    resource_ref: demo.my_action
    policy_type: action.concurrency
    parameters:
        action: cancel
        threshold: 1

action.concurrency.attr
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``action.concurrency.attr`` policy limits the executions for the action by input arguments.
Let's say ``demo.my_remote_action`` has an input argument called ``hostname``. This is the name of
the host where the remote command or script runs. By using the policy type
``action.concurrency.attr`` and specifying ``hostname`` as one of the attributes in the policy,
we can limit the number of concurrent ``demo.my_remote_action`` actions running for a given remote
host.

.. code-block:: yaml
   :emphasize-lines: 5,9,10

    name: my_remote_action.concurrency
    description: Limits the concurrent executions for my action.
    enabled: true
    resource_ref: demo.my_remote_action
    policy_type: action.concurrency.attr
    parameters:
        action: delay
        threshold: 10
        attributes:
            - hostname

.. note::

    The concurrency policy type is not enabled by default and requires a backend coordination
    service such as ZooKeeper or Redis to work.

If you have installed a coordination service in your network, you need to configure |st2| to
connect to that backend service. This is done in the ``coordination`` section of
``/etc/st2/st2.conf``.

The following are examples for ZooKeeper and Redis:

ZooKeeper:

.. code-block:: ini

    [coordination]
    url = kazoo://username:password@host:port


Redis:

.. code-block:: ini

    [coordination]
    url = redis://:password@host:port

Other supported coordination backends include:

* consul
* etcd
* MySQL
* PostgreSQL
* file (for testing when all the services are running on a single host)

For the full list of the supported backends and how to configure them, please visit
`OpenStack Tooz documentation <https://docs.openstack.org/tooz/latest/>`_.

Some of these coordination backends also require corresponding client libraries to be installed
in |st2| virtualenv. We do not ship these libraries by default. As an example, to install the client
library in |st2| virtualenv, run:

.. sourcecode:: bash

    sudo su

    # Example when using redis backend
    /opt/stackstorm/st2/bin/pip install redis

    # Example when using consul backend
    /opt/stackstorm/st2/bin/pip install consul

Retry
-----

Retry policy (``action.retry``) allows you to automatically retry (re-run) an action when a
particular failure condition is met. Right now we support retrying actions which have failed or
timed out.

The example below shows how to automatically retry the ``core.http`` action up to two times if it
times out:

.. literalinclude:: /../../st2/contrib/hello_st2/policies/retry_core_http_on_timeout.yaml
   :language: yaml

Keep in mind that retrying an execution results in a new execution which shares all the attributes
from the retried execution (parameters, context, etc).

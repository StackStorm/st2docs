Coordination
============

Coordination backend is required to support workflows with multiple branches or tasks with items and
actions with concurrency policies defined.

StackStorm utilizes the ``OpenStack Tooz`` library for communicating with the coordination backend.
The coordination backend must support the ``Locking`` functionality as defined by the ``Tooz`` 
interface. Please refrence the `OpenStack Tooz compatability page <https://docs.openstack.org/tooz/latest/user/compatibility.html>`_
for more information what interfaces are implemented by various backends.

The following is a list of backends that can be configured for the coordination service. For the
full list of the supported backends and how to configure them, please visit
`OpenStack Tooz documentation <https://docs.openstack.org/tooz/latest/>`_.
 
 * Redis
 * Zookeeper
 * consul
 * etcd
 * file (for testing when all the services are running on a single host)

The configuration of the coordination service is done in the ``coordination`` section
of ``/etc/st2/st2.conf``. The following are configuration examples for Redis and Zookeeper.

Redis:

.. code-block:: ini

    [coordination]
    url = redis://:password@host:port

ZooKeeper:

.. code-block:: ini

    [coordination]
    url = kazoo://username:password@host:port

Some of these coordination backends also require corresponding client libraries to be installed
in |st2| virtualenv. 
Since |st2| v3.5 the redis client libraries are included with the st2 package, but for
all other versions or coordination backends, we do not ship these libraries by default. 
As an example, to install the client library in |st2| virtualenv, run:

.. sourcecode:: bash

    sudo su

    # Example when using consul backend
    /opt/stackstorm/st2/bin/pip install consul

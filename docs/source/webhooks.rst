Webhooks
========

Webhooks allow you to integrate external systems with |st2| using HTTP webhooks. Unlike sensors
which use a "pull" approach, webhooks use a "push" approach. They push triggers directly to the
|st2| API using HTTP POST requests.

Sensors vs Webhooks
-------------------

Sensors integrate with external systems and services using either a polling approach (sensors
periodically connect to an external system to retrieve data), or a passive approach, where they
listen on some port, receiving data using whatever custom protocol you define. 

Webhooks provide a built-in passive approach for receiving JSON or URL-encoded form data, via
HTTP POST. This data must be "pushed" from an external system to |st2| when an interesting event
occurs.

Sensors are the preferred integration method since they offer a more granular and tighter
integration.

On the other hand, webhooks come in handy when you have an existing script or software which you
can easily modify to send a webhook to the |st2| API when an intersting event occurs.

Another example where webhooks are useful is when you want to consume events from a 3rd party
service that already offers webhook integration - e.g. GitHub.

Authentication
--------------

All requests to the ``/api/v1/webhooks`` endpoints need to be authenticated in the same way as other
API requests. There are two possible authentication approaches - :ref:`API keys
<authentication-apikeys>` and tokens. API keys are recommended for webhooks, as they do not
expire. Tokens have a fixed expiry.

API key-based
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* `Header` : ``St2-Api-Key``
* `Query parameter` : ``?st2-api-key``

Token-based
~~~~~~~~~~~

* `Header` : ``X-Auth-Token``
* `Query parameter` : ``?x-auth-token``


Both methods above support providing the authentication material as a header or query parameter.
A header is usually used with your scripts where you can control request headers while query
parameters are used with 3rd party services such as GitHub where you can only specify a URL.

Request Body
------------

The request body or so called trigger payload can be either JSON or URL encoded form data. The
body type is determined based on the value of the ``Content-Type`` header (``application/json``
for JSON and ``application/x-www-form-urlencoded`` for URL encoded form data).

All the examples below assume JSON and as such, provide ``application/json`` for the
``Content-Type`` header value.

Registering a Webhook
---------------------

You can register a webhook in |st2| by specifying the ``core.st2.webhook`` trigger inside a rule
definition.

Here is an excerpt from a rule which registers a new webhook named ``sample``:

.. sourcecode:: yaml

    ...
    trigger:
            type: "core.st2.webhook"
            parameters:
                url: "sample"
    ...

The ``url:`` parameter above is added as a suffix to ``/api/v1/webhooks/`` to create the URL to
POST data to. So once you have created the rule above, you can use this webhook by POST-ing data
to your |st2| server at ``https://{$ST2_IP}/api/v1/webhooks/sample``.

The request body needs to be JSON and may contain arbitrary data which you can match against in
the rule criteria.

Note that all trailing and leading ``/`` of the ``url`` parameter are ignored by |st2|. e.g. a
value of ``/sample``, ``sample/``, ``/sample/`` and ``sample`` are all treated the same, i.e.
considered identical. They all result in an effective URL of ``/api/v1/webhooks/sample``.

POST-ing data to a custom webhook will cause a trigger with the following attributes to be
dispatched:

* ``trigger`` - Trigger name.
* ``trigger.headers`` - Dictionary containing the request headers.
* ``trigger.body`` - Dictionary containing the request body.

This example shows how to send data to a custom webhook using ``curl`` and how to match on this
data using rule criteria:

.. sourcecode:: bash

    curl -X POST https://localhost/api/v1/webhooks/sample -H "X-Auth-Token: matoken" -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data '{"key1": "value1"}'

Rule:

.. sourcecode:: yaml

    ...
    trigger:
            type: "core.st2.webhook"
            parameters:
                url: "sample"

    criteria:
        trigger.body.key1:
            type: "equals"
            pattern: "value1"

    action:
        ref: "mypack.myaction"
        parameters:
    ...

Using a Generic Webhook
-----------------------

By default, a special-purpose webhook with the name ``st2`` is already registered. Instead of
using ``st2.core.webhook``, it allows you to specify any trigger that is known to |st2| (either by
default or from custom sensors and triggers in packs), so you can use it to trigger rules that
arenâ€™t explicitly set up to be triggered by webhooks.

The body of this request needs to be JSON and must contain the following attributes:

* ``trigger`` - Name of the trigger (e.g. ``mypack.mytrigger``)
* ``payload`` - Object with a trigger payload.

This example shows how to send data to the generic webhook using ``curl``, and how to match this
data using rule criteria (replace ``localhost`` with your st2 host if called remotely):

.. sourcecode:: bash

    curl -X POST https://localhost/api/v1/webhooks/st2 -H "X-Auth-Token: matoken" -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data '{"trigger": "mypack.mytrigger", "payload": {"attribute1": "value1"}}'

Rule:

.. sourcecode:: yaml

    ...
    trigger:
        type: "mypack.mytrigger"

    criteria:
        trigger.attribute1:
            type: "equals"
            pattern: "value1"

    action:
        ref: "mypack.myaction"
        parameters:
    ...

The ``trigger.type`` attribute in the rule definition needs to be the same as the trigger name
defined in the webhook payload body.

Listing Registered Webhooks
---------------------------

To list all registered webhooks, run:

.. code-block:: bash

    st2 webhook list

My Webhook Isn't Working!
-------------------------

If you're encountering issues with webhooks, such as |st2| failing to recognize incoming webhooks, or trigger
instances not showing when expected, please see :doc:`Troubleshooting Webhooks</troubleshooting/webhooks>`.

When Not to Use Webhooks
------------------------

While webhooks are useful, they do have two drawbacks:

* **Not Bidirectional**  - Webhooks simply submit data into |st2|. So if you want data back from
  |st2|, or an action execution ID, you'll have to get that data in an asynchronous fashion.
* **No Guarantee of Execution** - Webhooks in |st2| do not guarantee an execution. It depends on
  the rule configuration. Based upon the webhook contents, it may not execute any action, or may 
  execute multiple actions.

If you always want to execute a specific action or workflow, and/or you're looking for a
guaranteed response, you can use the ``/v1/executions`` API. This is the same as explicitly
running an action from the CLI with ``st2 run <mypack>.<myaction>``. 

We can get a little insight into how this work using the ``--debug`` flag:

.. sourcecode:: bash

    st2 --debug run core.local "date"

In addition to the "usual" output that shows the result of the execution, the ``--debug`` flag also
shows all the API calls made during the course of the entire interaction, in the form of ``curl``
commands.

That output shows the API calls made when executing the command from the |st2| host. If you are
accessing the API from a remote system, it will be proxied through nginx, using the ``/api`` URI.
So remote calls will take this form:

.. sourcecode:: bash

    curl -X POST https://[ST2_IP]/v1/executions -H  'Connection: keep-alive' -H  'Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate' -H  'Accept: */*' -H  'User-Agent: python-requests/2.11.1' -H  'content-type: application/json' -H  'X-Auth-Token: matoken' -H  'Content-Length: 69' --data-binary '{"action": "core.local", "user": null, "parameters": {"cmd": "date"}}'

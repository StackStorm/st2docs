Using DEB/RPM
-------------

To install StackStorm Enterprise with ``DEB or RPM`` packages, obtain your Enterprise licensekey and
proceed to installation steps for :doc:`/install/deb`, :doc:`/install/rhel7`, or
:doc:`/install/rhel6`. The last step of the instructions is installing `st2enterprise`. Use your
license key to get access to enterprise package repositories.

Using AIO installer
-------------------
If you choose to use :doc:`/install/all_in_one` (recommended for evaluation on a clean box), you will be
presented with a screen that prompts for a license key. Check the "Enable enterprise features" and
input the license key in the field.

For unattended AIO installer, place the license key in the answers.yaml file, as described in
:ref:`all_in_one-enterprise_configuration_values` section of :doc:`/install/all_in_one`.

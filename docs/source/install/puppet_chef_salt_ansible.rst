Puppet
======

|st2| provides a supported Puppet module for use when deploying in an existing Puppet infrastructure. This module is designed to allow relative flexibility with the configuration methods and management techniques of the |st2| application.

This module aims to provide sane default configurations, but also stay out of your way in the event you need something more custom. To accomplish this, this module uses the Roles/Profiles pattern. Included in this module are several modules that come with sane defaults that you can use directly or use to compose your own site-specific profile for |st2| installation.

Supported Operating Systems
---------------------------
As of this writing, the following operating systems are supported:

* Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
* RedHat/CentOS 7.x
* RedHat/CentOS 6.x

Puppet Installation
-------------------
The Puppet module is updated frequently, and uploaded to the Puppet Forge on each release. You can find the module at https://forge.puppetlabs.com/stackstorm/st2

Manual Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The ``puppet module install`` action will install a module and all of its dependencies. By default, it will install into the first directory in Puppetâ€™s modulepath. To install the module from the Puppet Forge, simply type the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

   puppet module install stackstorm-st2

Puppetfile
~~~~~~~~~~
Alternatively, you can install this module using ``librarian-puppet`` or ``r10k`` and add this file to your ``Puppetfile``. Add the following line:

.. code-block:: bash

   mod "stackstorm/st2"

Getting Started
---------------
Getting started is very easy. Several pre-configured profiles have been included out-of-the-box to get you started with minimal effort. We will go over this method, as well as how to consume the individual portions of the module.


Quick Start
~~~~~~~~~~~
For a full installation on a single node, a profile already exists to get you setup and going with minimal effort. Simply add the following class declaration to your site or node manifest.

.. code-block:: bash

   include ::st2::profile::fullinstall

This module will install |st2| and all its dependencies with sane defaults. This class is a great way to test out |st2| in your environment, or to take a look at how each of the different components composes to create a |st2| installation profile.

Profiles
~~~~~~~~
In addition to providing a full-install profile, each of the separate profiles are broken up to allow flexibly in defining a site-specific |st2| profile. Within the module exist several default-configured profiles for the components of |st2| and its dependencies.

The full list of profiles are:

* ``st2::profile::client``      - Profile to install all client libraries for st2
* ``st2::profile::fullinstall`` - Full installation of |st2| and dependencies
* ``st2::profile::mistral``     - Install of OpenStack Mistral
* ``st2::profile::mongodb``     - st2 configured MongoDB installation
* ``st2::profile::nodejs``      - st2 configured NodeJS installation
* ``st2::profile::python``      - Python installed and configured for st2
* ``st2::profile::rabbitmq``    - st2 configured RabbitMQ installation
* ``st2::proflle::server``      - st2 server components
* ``st2::profile::web``         - st2 web components

When composing a site-profile, select the various components of the |st2| installation to deploy. An example configuration profile can be found in the *st2workroom* project at http://git.io/v3Z5B.

Configuration
-------------
Configuration can be done directly via code composition, or set via Hiera data bindings. By design, all of the configuration options available to the user are set at the top-level of the module. The configuration values are:

*  ``version``            - Version of |st2| to install
*  ``revision``           - Revision of |st2| to install
*  ``mistral_git_branch`` - Tagged branch of Mistral to download/install
*  ``api_url``            - URL where the |st2| API lives (default: undef)
*  ``auth``               - Toggle to enable/disable auth (Default: false)
*  ``auth_url``           - URL where the |st2| WebUI lives (default: undef)
*  ``cli_base_url``       - CLI config - Base URL lives
*  ``cli_api_version``    - CLI config - API Version
*  ``cli_debug``          - CLI config - Enable/Disable Debug
*  ``cli_cache_token``    - CLI config - True to cache auth token until expries
*  ``cli_username``       - CLI config - Auth Username
*  ``cli_password``       - CLI config - Auth Password
*  ``cli_api_url``        - CLI config - API URL
*  ``cli_auth_url``       - CLI config - Auth URL
*  ``workers``            - Set the number of actionrunner processes to start
*  ``ng_init``            - [Experimental] Init scripts for services. Upstart ONLY

Class Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Any of the module configuration settings can be set at declaration. An example of this:

.. code-block:: puppet

   class { '::st2':
     auth     => true,
     auth_url => 'https://st2auth.stackstorm.net',
   }

When composing your own profile, you can include ``Class[::st2]`` into your catalog to set any variables necessary.

Hiera Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Likewise, module configuration can be set via Hiera. For example in a hiera data file:

.. code-block:: yaml

   st2::auth: true
   st2::auth_url: https://st2auth.stackstorm.net

Pack Installation and Management
--------------------------------

|st2| packs can be installed and configured directly from Puppet. This can be done via the ``st2::pack`` and ``st2::pack::config`` defined types.

Defined Types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: puppet

    st2::pack { 'linux': }
    st2::pack { ['librato', 'consul']:
      repo_url => 'https://github.com/StackStorm/st2incubator.git',
    }
    st2::pack { 'slack':
      repo_url => 'https://github.com/StackStorm/st2incubator.git',
      config     => {
        'post_message_action' => {
          'webhook_url'         => 'XXX',
        },
      },
    }

Hiera
~~~~~
In order to load packs via hiera, you will need to include the `::st2::packs` class in your site profile. Then, values will be read from Hiera.

.. code-block:: yaml

    st2::packs:
    linux:
        ensure: present
    cicd:
        ensure: present
        repo_url: https://github.com/StackStorm/st2incubator.git
    slack:
        ensure: present
        repo_url: https://github.com/StackStorm/st2incubator.git
        config:
        post_message_action:
            webhook_url: XXX

Ansible playbooks to install |st2|.

Allows you to deploy and further configure |st2| installation on local or remote machines with Ansible configuration management tool.
Playbooks source code is available as GitHub repository `ansible-st2

+------------------------+-----------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ``st2_revision``       | ``current``     | |st2| revision to install. ``current`` to get the                        |
|                        |                 | latest build (autoupdating) or pin it to numeric build like ``6``.       |
+------------------------+-----------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ``st2_action_runners`` | ``# vCPUs``     | Number of action runner workers to start.                                |
|                        |                 | Defaults to number of machine vCPUs, but not less than ``2``.            |

+------------------------+-----------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Examples
---------------------------
Install ``stable`` |st2| with all its components on local machine:

.. sourcecode:: bash

    ansible-playbook playbooks/st2express.yaml -i 'localhost,' --connection=local


.. note::

    Keeping ``stable`` version is useful to update |st2| by re-running playbook, since it will reinstall |st2| if there is new version available.
    This is default behavior. If you don't want updates - consider pinning version numbers.

Install specific numeric version of st2 with pinned revision number as well:

.. sourcecode:: bash

    ansible-playbook playbooks/st2express.yaml --extra-vars='st2_version=0.12.2 st2_revision=6'

or latest unstable (development branch):

.. sourcecode:: bash

    ansible-playbook playbooks/st2express.yaml --extra-vars='st2_version=unstable'

Installation
============

That's OK! You're busy, we get it. How do you just get started? Get yourself a clean 64-bit Linux
box that fits the :doc:`system requirements <system_requirements>`. Make sure that ``curl`` is up to date
using ``sudo apt-get install curl`` on Ubuntu, or ``sudo yum install curl nss`` on RHEL/CentOS. Then run
this command:

.. code-block:: bash

   curl -sSL https://stackstorm.com/packages/v2.1/install.sh | bash -s -- --user=st2admin --password=Ch@ngeMe

It will install and configure the stable version of StackStorm, as per the
:doc:`single host reference deployment <./overview>`.
The installation takes about 4 minutes.
Once it completes successfully, you will see the following output:

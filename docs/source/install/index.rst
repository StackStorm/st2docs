Installation
============

Ready to install |st2|? Here's an overview of how to get your system up and running.

|st2| is distributed as RPMs and Debs for RedHat/CentOS and Ubuntu Linux systems, and as Docker
images. You can either use a script to automatically install and configure all components on a
single system, or you can follow the manual instructions for your OS.

.. warning::

    StackStorm is developed and tested against the x86_64 architecture on the GNU/Linux platform using **Ubuntu** and **Rocky/CentOS**.

    We would like to be able to support alternative architectures (arm, risc-v, mips etc.), platforms (Microsoft Windows, Apple OSX, FreeBSD)
    and distributions (SuSe, Arch, Gentoo, etc), however we have a finite set of resources which prevents us from doing so.  If you build and operate
    StackStorm using these alternatives, you accept the responsibility of addressing any issues encountered yourself and understand no official support is available.

Here's an overview of the options:

* **One-line Install:** Run our installation script for an opinionated install of all components
  on a single system. This is a our recommended way to get started. See the :ref:`Quick Install
  <ref-one-line-install>` section below for details.
* **Manual Installation:** Have custom needs? Maybe no Internet access from your servers? Or just
  don't like using scripted installs? Read the manual installation instructions for your OS
  (:doc:`Ubuntu 18 </install/u18>`, :doc:`Ubuntu 20 </install/u20>`,
  :doc:`RHEL/CentOS 7 </install/rhel7>`, :doc:`RHEL/RockyLinux/CentOS 8 </install/rhel8>`) and adapt them to
  your needs. Here's some `additional guidance
  <https://stackstorm.com/2017/02/10/installing-stackstorm-offline-systems/>`_ for setting up an
  internal mirror for the |st2| repos.
* **Vagrant / Virtual Appliance:** Vagrant / OVA is a quick and easy way to try StackStorm.
  It's already pre-installed, tested and shipped as a virtual image and so saves your time going
  through time-consuming installation and configuration steps. Works best as a testing,
  pack development or demo system and recommended to get familiar with StackStorm platform.
  ``vagrant init stackstorm/st2 && vagrant up`` is all you need to get started.
  See :doc:`Vagrant </install/vagrant>` for more detailed instructions.
* **Docker:** StackStorm is supported on Docker - check out our :doc:`/install/docker` instructions.
  It's one of the quickest way to get StackStorm running and useful for trying the platform and development.
* **Ansible Playbooks:** If you are an Ansible user, check these :doc:`/install/ansible` for
  installing |st2|. Ideal for repeatable, consistent, idempotent installation of |st2|.
* **Puppet Module:** For Puppet users, check this :doc:`/install/puppet` for
  installing StackStorm. A robust and idempotent method of installing and configuring StackStorm.
* **Kubernetes (HA)** Entrusting business critical automation tasks to a system like StackStorm
  leads to higher demands on that system. StackStorm can run in a High Availability mode to ensure these needs.
  :doc:`/install/k8s_ha` automates entire complex infrastructure as a reproducible blueprint.


Choose the option that best suits your needs.

.. rubric:: Quick Install

Grab a **clean** 64-bit Linux system that fits the :doc:`system requirements
<system_requirements>`. Make sure that ``curl`` is up to date using ``sudo apt-get install curl``
on Ubuntu, or ``sudo yum install curl nss`` on RHEL/RockyLinux/CentOS. Then run this command:

.. code-block:: bash

   bash <(curl -sSL https://stackstorm.com/packages/install.sh) --user=st2admin --password=Ch@ngeMe

This is an opinionated installation of |st2|. It will download and install all components, as per
the :doc:`single host reference deployment <./overview>`. It assumes that you have a clean, basic
installation of Ubuntu or RHEL/RockyLinux/CentOS.

If you are trying to install |st2| on a server with other applications, or local customisations,
you may run into problems. In that case, you should use one of the manual installation methods.

The script itself is not idempotent. If you try to re-run the script on top of a failed
installation, it will fail. Start again with a clean system, or switch to a manual install.

If you're installing behind a proxy, just export the proxy ENV variables
``http_proxy``, ``https_proxy``, ``no_proxy`` before running the script.

.. code-block:: bash

  export http_proxy=http://proxy.server.io:port
  export https_proxy=http://proxy.server.io:port
  export no_proxy=localhost,127.0.0.1

In case of MITM proxy, you may need to export additional ``proxy_ca_bundle_path``, see :ref:`packs-behind-proxy`.


If you have problems accessing the Web UI on a RHEL 7/CentOS 7 system, check the
:ref:`system firewall settings <ref-rhel7-firewall>`.

If you're just looking for a quick "one-liner" installation, check the :doc:`top-level install
guide </install/index>`. If you need a customised installation, use this guide for step-by-step
instructions for installing |st2| on a single system as per the
:doc:`Reference deployment </install/overview>`.

.. note:: 

  `Use the Source, Luke! <http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?UseTheSourceLuke>`_ We strive to keep the
  documentation current, but the best way to find out what really happens is to look at the code
  of the `installer scripts
  <https://github.com/StackStorm/st2-packages/tree/master/scripts>`_.

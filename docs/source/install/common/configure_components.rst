If you are not running RabbitMQ, MongoDB, or Redis on the same system, or have changed the
defaults, please adjust these settings:

* RabbitMQ connection at ``/etc/st2/st2.conf``
* MongoDB at ``/etc/st2/st2.conf``
* Redis connection at coordination section of ``/etc/st2/st2.conf``

See the :doc:`Configuration documentation </install/config/config>` for more information.

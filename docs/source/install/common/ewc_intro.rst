For StackStorm versions earlier than 3.3, Extreme Networks provided a commercial version of the StackStorm automation platform (EWC). EWC added priority
support, advanced features such as fine-tuned access control (RBAC), LDAP, and Workflow Designer.

As these enterprise features were donated to the Linux Foundation, RBAC, LDAP and Workflow Designer components are now available in StackStorm Open Source since 3.4. The Workflow Designer is integrated into the StackStorm Web UI, and RBAC and LDAP components are installed (but not configured) with the default installation.

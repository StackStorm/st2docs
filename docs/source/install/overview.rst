Overview: Single-box Reference Deployment
==========================================

This page describes a "reference deployment" of all |st2| components installed on a single system.
It explains what the main components are, their role, and how they are wired together.

If you use the :doc:`one line quick install script </install/index/>`, it will set up your system
as shown below:

1. st2 services
----------------
"st2" services provide the main |st2| functionality. They are located at ``/opt/stackstorm/st2``,
share a dedicated Python virtualenv, and are configured via ``/etc/st2/st2.conf``.

* **st2sensorcontainer** runs sensors from ``/opt/stackstorm/packs``. It manages the sensors to be
  run on a node. It will start, stop and restart based on policy the sensors running on a node.
* **st2rulesengine** evaluates rules when it sees TriggerInstances and decides if an
  ActionExecution is to be requested. It needs access to MongoDB to locate rules and RabbitMQ to
  listen for TriggerInstances and request ActionExecutions. The auxiliary purpose of this process
  is to run all the defined timers.
* **st2actionrunners** run actions from packs under ``/opt/stackstorm/packs`` via a variety of
  :doc:`/reference/runners`. Runners may require some runner-specific configurations, e.g. SSH
  needs to be configured for running remote actions based on ``remote-shell-runner`` and
  ``remote-command-runner``. Windows prerequisites must be in place to run Windows runners. See
  :doc:`Runners </reference/runners>` for details.
* **st2resultstracker** keeps track of long-running workflow executions, calling the Mistral API
  endpoint.
* **st2notifier** generates ``st2.core.actiontrigger`` and ``st2.core.notifytrigger``
  TriggerInstances on the completion of an ActionExecution. The auxiliary purpose is to act as a backup scheduler for actions that may not have been scheduled.
* **st2garbagecollector** is an optional service to periodically delete old execution history data
  from the database, per settings in ``/etc/st2/st2.conf``.
* **st2auth** is an authentication service with a REST endpoint. A variety of authentication
  backends are available; see :doc:`/authentication` for more details. The reference deployment
  uses `flat file auth backend <https://github.com/StackStorm/st2-auth-backend-flat-file>`_.
* **st2api** is REST API web service endpoint, used by CLI and WebUI. It also serves webhooks for
  webhook triggers.
* **st2stream** is an event stream consumption HTTP endpoint where various useful events are
  posted. These events are consumed by WebUI and hubot i.e. ChatOps to update with results etc.

2. st2client
-------------

``st2client`` is the CLI and Python bindings for the |st2| API. To configure the CLI to point to
the right API, authentication options, suppress insecure warnings for self-signed certificates and
other conveniences see the :doc:`/reference/cli`. ``st2client`` is packaged with ``st2``, or can be
installed independently.

3. st2mistral
--------------

:doc:`/mistral` is a workflow service component that |st2| uses for long-running workflows. It
is packaged as ``st2mistral``, installed under ``/opt/stackstorm/mistral``, runs in a dedicated
Python virtualenv, and is configured via ``/etc/mistral/mistral.conf``. ``mistral-server`` runs
workflow logic and calling actions, reaching out to st2api for action execution requests.
``st2mistral`` is a mistral plugin with stackstorm extensions. ``mistral-api`` is an internal
end-point accessed by ``st2actionrunner`` and ``st2notifier``. In a single-box deployment it is
restricted to localhost.

4. NGINX for WebUI and SSL termination
--------------------------------------
* **nginx** provides SSL termination, redirects HTTP to HTTPS, serves WebUI static components, and
  reverse-proxies REST API endpoints to st2* web services.
* **StackStorm WebUI** (st2web, and Workflow Designer, for Brocade Workflow Composer) are
  installed at ``/opt/stackstorm/static/webui`` and configured via ``webui/config.js``. ``st2web``
  comes in its own ``deb`` and ``rpm`` package. Workflow Designer is deployed as part of the
  ``bwc-enterprise`` package. They are HTML5 applications, served as static HTML, and call |st2|
  st2auth and st2api REST API endpoints. NGINX proxies inbound requests to ``/api`` and ``/auth``
  to the st2api and st2auth services respectively.

5. st2chatops - ChatOps components
----------------------------------
|st2| Chatops components are `Hubot <https://hubot.github.com/>`_, `|st2|'s Hubot adapter
<https://github.com/StackStorm/hubot-stackstorm>`_, and plugins for connecting to `different Chat
services <https://hubot.github.com/docs/adapters/>`_. They are packaged as ``st2chatops``,
installed at ``/opt/stackstorm/chatops/`` and configured in
``/opt/stackstorm/chatops/st2chatops.env``.

ChatOps can be also enabled by installing `hubot-stackstorm plugin
<https://github.com/StackStorm/hubot-stackstorm>`_ on your existing Hubot instance.

Dependencies
------------
The required dependencies are RabbitMQ, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL. The optional dependencies are:

  - nginx for SSL termination, reverse-proxying API endpoints and serving static HTML.
  - Redis or Zookeeper for concurrency policies (see :doc:`/reference/policies`).
  - LDAP for Brocade Workflow Composer LDAP authentication.


Multi-box/HA deployment
-----------------------
For specific information on multi-box deployments to achieve HA or horizontal scale see

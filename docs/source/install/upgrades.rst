Upgrades
========

When new versions of |st2| are released, they are published to our APT and Yum repositories. You
can use standard Linux package management tools to install these upgraded packages.

For StackStorm versions prior to 3.3 then the general upgrade procedure included scripts to upgrade the Mistral Database, prior
to restarting |st2| services. See below for more details. Depending on the versions you are upgrading to and
from, you may need to run additional :ref:`migration scripts<migration-scripts-to-run>`.

If you skipped a version and are upgrading to a newer version, please make sure you also run the
migration scripts for skipped versions.

Update GPG Key
--------------

.. warning::

    The GPG keys used for signing our apt and yum repository metadata have been updated. If you are upgrading
    an existing system that has the old keys installed, it will need updating. See the instructions below for
    how to do this.

    Failure to update the keys will result in signature verification errors during package update.

For |st2| community version on Ubuntu, run the following command to update your keys. If you
are running a non production version of StackStorm, then replace ``stable`` in the URL with the
appropriate repository name.

.. sourcecode:: bash

    curl -s https://packagecloud.io/install/repositories/StackStorm/stable/script.deb.sh | sudo bash

For |st2| enterprise version (only available for |st2| <= 3.2) on Ubuntu, both the gpg keys for community and enterprise need to be
imported separately. Run the following commands to update both keys. If you are running
a non production version of StackStorm, then replace ``stable`` in the curl with the appropriate
repository name. Replace ``<license_key>`` with your enterprise license key.

.. sourcecode:: bash

    curl -s https://packagecloud.io/install/repositories/StackStorm/stable/script.deb.sh | sudo bash
    curl -s https://<license_key>:@packagecloud.io/install/repositories/StackStorm/enterprise/script.deb.sh | sudo bash

For reference, the following is the error shown if the new gpg key(s) is not added on Ubuntu. Please
note the URLs that failed on retrieval should be ``https://packagecloud.io/StackStorm/stable`` for the
|st2| community and ``https://packagecloud.io/StackStorm/enterprise`` for the |st2| enterprise repo::

    $ sudo apt-get update

    W: Some index files failed to download. They have been ignored, or old ones used instead.

For |st2| community version on RHEL/CentOS, run the following command to update the keys. If you
are running a non production version of StackStorm, then replace ``stable`` in the URL with the
appropriate repository name.

.. sourcecode:: bash

    curl -s https://packagecloud.io/install/repositories/StackStorm/stable/script.rpm.sh | sudo bash

For |st2| enterprise version (only available for |st2| <= 3.2) on RHEL/CentOS, both the gpg keys for community and enterprise need to be
import separately. Run the following commands to update the keys. If you are running a
non production version of StackStorm, then replace ``stable`` in the URLs with the appropriate
repository name. Replace ``<license_key>`` with your enterprise license key.

.. sourcecode:: bash

    curl -s https://packagecloud.io/install/repositories/StackStorm/stable/script.rpm.sh | sudo bash
    curl -s https://<license_key>:@packagecloud.io/install/repositories/StackStorm/enterprise/script.rpm.sh | sudo bash

If the new gpg keys are not setup in advanced on RHEL/CentOS, running ``yum update`` will auto-retrieve
the new gpg key for appropriate respository. ``yum update`` will ask if you want to import the new gpg keys.
Verify that the key is retrieved from ``https://packagecloud.io/StackStorm/stable/gpgkey`` for the |st2|
community and enter ``y`` to confirm. For |st2| enterprise repo, an additional key needs to be retrieved from
``https://packagecloud.io/StackStorm/enterprise/gpgkey``.

For reference, the following is a sample output from ``yum update``. Please note the URLs where the key
is retrieved from should be ``https://packagecloud.io/StackStorm/stable`` for the
|st2| community and ``https://packagecloud.io/StackStorm/enterprise`` for the |st2| enterprise repo::

General Upgrade Procedure
-------------------------

This is the standard upgrade procedure:

1. Stop ``st2*`` services, and check all processes have terminated:

   .. sourcecode:: bash

      sudo st2ctl stop
      ps auxww | grep st2

   If any `st2`-related processes are still running, kill them with `kill -9`.

2. Upgrade |st2| packages using distro-specific tools:

   .. note::

     Refer to the version specific changes section below, for steps that may be required before or after upgrading packages.

   Ubuntu:

   .. sourcecode:: bash

      sudo apt-get install --only-upgrade st2 st2web st2chatops

   RHEL/CentOS:

   .. sourcecode:: bash

      sudo yum update st2 st2web st2chatops

.. note::

  If upgrading to a version earlier than StackStorm 3.3, add st2mistral to list of packages to update (if it is present on your current system).


3. Run the migration scripts (if any). See below for version-specific migration scripts.

4. Ensure all content is registered:

   .. sourcecode:: bash

      sudo st2ctl reload --register-all

5. Start |st2| services:

   .. sourcecode:: bash

      sudo st2ctl start

.. _migration-scripts-to-run:

Version-Specific Changes / Migration Scripts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We document :ref:`upgrade notes<upgrade_notes>` for the various versions. The upgrade notes section gives
an idea of what major changes happened with each release. You may also want to take a look at the detailed
:doc:`/changelog` for each version.

The following sections call out the migration scripts that need to be run when upgrading to the
respective version. If you are upgrading across multiple versions, make sure you run the scripts for
any skipped versions:

v3.5
''''
* Node.js v14 is now used by ChatOps (previously v10 was used). The following procedure should be
  used to upgrade:

  Ubuntu:

  .. sourcecode:: bash

     curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | sudo -E bash -
     sudo apt-get install --only-upgrade nodejs st2chatops

  RHEL/CentOS:

  .. sourcecode:: bash

     sudo sed -i.bak 's|^baseurl=\(https://rpm.nodesource.com\)/[^/]\{1,\}/\(.*\)$|baseurl=\1/pub_14.x/\2|g' /etc/yum.repos.d/nodesource-*.repo
     sudo yum clean all
     sudo rpm -e --nodeps nodejs
     sudo yum upgrade st2chatops

* The default st2 nginx configuration has been updated to support only TLSv1.2 and v1.3 on nginx. The package upgrade does not update the deployed nginx configuration with the packaged version (/usr/share/doc/st2/conf/nginx/st2.conf), therefore the nginx ST2 configuration will need to be updated manually and nginx restarted:

  .. sourcecode:: bash

     sudo sed -i.bak 's|ssl_protocols.*|ssl_protocols             TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;|g' /etc/nginx/conf.d/st2.conf
     sudo systemctl restart nginx

* The packaged st2.conf has been altered in this release to use redis for the coordination url, see point below.
  Depending on your distribution, when the st2 package is upgraded it will either ask you which version to use,
  or will save a copy of the new st2.conf.
  You are advised to review the differences between your current st2.conf and the packaged st2.conf
  to create a merged st2.conf for your particular installation.

* Redis server is installed and configured as backend for the coordination service
  by default in the single node installation script to support workflows with multiple
  branches and tasks with items. Upgrade requires coordination server and service to be setup
  manually. For workflows to be executed properly, setup the coordination service
  accordingly. See :doc:`../coordination` for setup instructions.

* If the ``st2ctl reload`` fails indicating problems with the packs due to duplicate keys, then the following command can be run to find all errors on the affected packs:

  .. sourcecode:: bash

     /opt/stackstorm/st2/bin/st2-validate-pack -p <path to pack>


v3.4
''''

*  |st2| now uses python 3 on Ubuntu 16 and RHEL/CentOS 7. Therefore any packs that only support python 2 will need to be upgraded to python 3.

* *RHEL 7.x only.* Ensure python3-devel can be installed from an enabled repository before upgrading |st2| packages:

  .. note::

     On CentOS 7.x these steps are not required as python3-devel is available by default in the enabled repositories, and therefore will get installed automatically when the st2 RPM is upgraded:


  * Check if python3-devel is already available in an enabled repository:

  .. sourcecode:: bash

    sudo yum info python3-devel

  * If it is not available, then locate the name of the optional server RPMs repository:

  .. sourcecode:: bash

    sudo yum repolist disabled | grep optional | grep server

  * Either enable the optional repository using subscription-manager or yum-config-manager, or install python3-devel with a temporary repository enablement, e.g.:

  .. sourcecode:: bash

    sudo yum install python3-devel --enablerepo <optional-server-rpm repo>

* *Ubuntu 16.04 Xenial only.* Python 3.6 is not available in the base Ubuntu Xenial distribution. Python 3.6 must be available before you upgrade |st2| packages, but you can add the unofficial 3rd party `Python PPA repository <https://launchpad.net/~deadsnakes/+archive/ubuntu/ppa>`_: which contains packages for Python 3.6.

  .. warning::

     Please be aware of the support and security risks associated with using unofficial 3rd party PPA repository.
     StackStorm does NOT provide ANY support or security update for python3.6 packages on Ubuntu 16.04.
     If security is a priority for you, we recommend starting migrating to Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (Bionic) or 20.04 LTS (Focal) as a base OS which has official python 3.6 packages.
     This is a workaround to support Ubuntu Xenial with python 3 until we deprecate it in the future versions.

  .. sourcecode:: bash

    sudo apt-get install -y software-properties-common
    # add unofficial 3rd party python3 PPA repository
    sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:deadsnakes/ppa
    sudo apt-get update

    # ensure python3.6 package exists and could be installed
    apt-cache show python3.6

*  *Ubuntu 16 and RHEL/CentOS 7 only*. All packs installed prior to upgrade will need to have their virtual environment re-created after upgrading |st2| packages (on all nodes which run st2actionrunner services), using the following command:

.. sourcecode:: bash

    sudo st2ctl reload --register-setup-recreate-virtualenvs


v3.3
''''

* MongoDB 4.0 is the new default version for all OS distributions. On RHEL/CentOS 7 and Ubuntu 16.04 the version of MongoDB was 3.4 previously.
  The supported upgrade path to MongoDB 4.0 is ``3.4 -> 3.6 -> 4.0``.
  Official documentation on how to upgrade MongoDB can be found here:
  * https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/release-notes/3.6-upgrade-standalone/
  * https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/release-notes/4.0-upgrade-standalone/

  A summary of the steps to take is outlined below assuming you will be migrating
  through the path ``3.4 -> 3.6 -> 4.0``.

  In the following steps, if you receive an error when setting the FeatureComptabilityVersion stating that admin is not authorized to execute the command, then you may need to add the root role to the admin user, e.g.

  .. sourcecode:: bash

    mongo admin --username admin --password Password --quiet --eval "db.grantRolesToUser('admin',[{role: 'root', db: 'admin'}])"

  Ubuntu 16.04:

  .. sourcecode:: bash

     # Ensure current MongoDB feature compatability level is set to 3.4
     mongo admin --username admin --password Password --quiet --eval "db.adminCommand( { setFeatureCompatibilityVersion: '3.4' } )"

     # Upgrade MongoDB packages to 3.6
     wget -qO - https://www.mongodb.org/static/pgp/server-3.6.asc | sudo apt-key add -
     sudo rm -f /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mongodb-org-3.4.list
     sudo sh -c "cat <<EOT > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mongodb-org-3.6.list
     deb http://repo.mongodb.org/apt/ubuntu $(lsb_release -c | awk '{print $2}')/mongodb-org/3.6 multiverse
     EOT"
     sudo apt-get update
     sudo apt-get -y clean
     sudo apt-get -y update
     sudo apt-get -y install mongodb-* --only-upgrade

     # Set MongoDB feature compatability level to 3.6
     mongo admin --username admin --password Password --quiet --eval "db.adminCommand( { setFeatureCompatibilityVersion: '3.6' } )"

     # Upgrade MongoDB packages to 4.0
     wget -qO - https://www.mongodb.org/static/pgp/server-4.0.asc | sudo apt-key add -
     sudo rm -f /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mongodb-org-3.6.list
     sudo sh -c "cat <<EOT > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mongodb-org-4.0.list
     deb http://repo.mongodb.org/apt/ubuntu $(lsb_release -c | awk '{print $2}')/mongodb-org/4.0  multiverse
     EOT"
     sudo apt-get update
     sudo apt-get -y clean
     sudo apt-get -y update
     sudo apt-get -y install mongodb-* --only-upgrade

     # Set MongoDB feature compatability level to 4.0
     mongo admin --username admin --password Password --quiet --eval "db.adminCommand( { setFeatureCompatibilityVersion: '4.0' } )"


  .. note::

     If after upgrading packages you cannot set the FeatureCompatibilityVersion to the upgraded software, then you may need to restart the mongod service.


  RHEL/CentOS 7.x:

  .. sourcecode:: bash

     # Ensure current MongoDB feature compatability level is set to 3.4
     mongo admin --username admin --password Password --quiet --eval "db.adminCommand( { setFeatureCompatibilityVersion: '3.4' } )"

     # Upgrade MongoDB packages to 3.6
     sudo sed -i 's/3\.4/3\.6/' /etc/yum.repos.d/mongodb*.repo
     sudo yum clean all
     sudo yum makecache fast
     sudo yum upgrade -y mongodb-*

     # Set MongoDB feature compatability level to 3.6
     mongo admin --username admin --password Password --quiet --eval "db.adminCommand( { setFeatureCompatibilityVersion: '3.6' } )"

     # Upgrade MongoDB packages to 4.0
     sudo sed -i 's/3\.6/4\.0/' /etc/yum.repos.d/mongodb*.repo
     sudo yum clean all
     sudo yum makecache fast
     sudo yum upgrade -y mongodb-*

     # Set MongoDB feature compatability level to 4.0
     mongo admin --username admin --password Password --quiet --eval "db.adminCommand( { setFeatureCompatibilityVersion: '4.0' } )"




* Mistral is no longer included in StackStorm and consequently Postgres is no longer required. Mistral and Postgres were previously installed on CentOS 7.x and Ubuntu 16.04 releases only.
  To uninstall Mistral and Postgres you may follow the procedure below (optional):


  Ubuntu 16.04:

  .. sourcecode:: bash

     # Stop the services
     sudo service mistral-server stop
     sudo service mistral-api stop
     sudo service mistral stop
     sudo service postgresql stop
     # Uninstall the packages
     sudo apt-get purge st2mistral
     # Remove databases
     sudo apt-get purge postgresql*
     # Clean up remaining content
     sudo rm -rf /var/log/mistral
     

  RHEL/CentOS 7.x:

  .. sourcecode:: bash

     # Stop the services
     sudo systemctl stop mistral*
     sudo systemctl stop postgresql
     # Uninstall the packages
     sudo yum erase st2mistral
     # Remove databases
     sudo yum erase postgresql*
     # Clean up remaining content
     sudo rm -rf /var/log/mistral
     sudo rm -rf /var/lib/pgsql

v2.10
'''''

* Node.js v10 is now used by ChatOps (previously v6 was used). The following procedure should be
  used to upgrade:

  Ubuntu:

  .. sourcecode:: bash

     curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_10.x | sudo -E bash -
     sudo apt-get install --only-upgrade st2chatops

  RHEL/CentOS:

     sudo sed -i.bak 's|^baseurl=\(https://rpm.nodesource.com\)/[^/]\{1,\}/\(.*\)$|baseurl=\1/pub_10.x/\2|g' /etc/yum.repos.d/nodesource-*.repo
     sudo yum clean all
     sudo rpm -e --nodeps npm
     sudo yum upgrade st2chatops
* Yammer support has been removed.

v2.9
''''

* This version introduced new ``st2timersengine`` service which needs to be configured in
  ``/etc/st2/st2.conf`` config file for it to work. For more information, please refer to Upgrade
  Notes - :ref:`ref-upgrade-notes-v2-9`.

v2.8
''''

* This version introduced new ``st2workflowengine`` service which needs to be configured in
  ``/etc/st2/st2.conf`` config file for it to work. For more information, please refer to Upgrade
  Notes - :ref:`ref-upgrade-notes-v2-8`.

v2.5
''''

* If you have the `DC Fabric Automation Suite <https://ewc-docs.extremenetworks.com/solutions/dcfabric/overview.html>`_
  version 1.1 installed, you must upgrade this to >= v1.1.1. Follow `these instructions <https://ewc-docs.extremenetworks.com/solutions/dcfabric/install.html#upgrade-from-previous-version>`_.

v2.4
''''

* Node.js v6 is now used by ChatOps (previously v4 was used). The following procedure should be
  used to upgrade:

  Ubuntu:

  .. sourcecode:: bash

     curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_6.x | sudo -E bash -
     sudo apt-get install --only-upgrade st2chatops

  RHEL/CentOS:

  .. sourcecode:: bash

     curl -sL https://rpm.nodesource.com/setup_6.x | sudo -E bash -
     sudo yum clean all
     sudo rpm -e --nodeps npm
     sudo yum upgrade st2chatops

* |ewc| users on RHEL or CentOS must run this command after upgrading packages:

  .. sourcecode:: bash

     sudo /opt/stackstorm/st2/bin/pip install --find-links /opt/stackstorm/share/wheels --no-index --quiet --upgrade st2-enterprise-auth-backend-ldap

This is a known issue, and will be resolved in a future release. This only applies to |ewc| users.
It is not required for those using Open Source StackStorm.

v2.2
''''

* The database schema for Mistral has changed. The executions_v2 table is no longer used. The
  table is being broken down into workflow_executions_v2, task_executions_v2, and
  action_executions_v2. After upgrade, using the Mistral commands from the command line such as
  ``mistral execution-list`` will return an empty table. The records in executions_v2 have not
  been deleted. The commands are reading from the new tables. There is currently no migration
  script to move existing records from executions_v2 into the new tables. To read from
  executions_v2, either use psql or install an older version of the python-mistralclient in a
  separate python virtual environment.

  .. warning::

     Please be sure to follow the general steps listed above to do the database upgrade.

  .. _mistral_db_recover:

*  If you're seeing an error ``event_triggers_v2 already exists`` when running
   ``mistral-db-manage upgrade head``, this means the mistral services started before the
   mistral-db-manage commands were run. SQLAlchemy automatically creates new tables in
   the updated database schema and it conflicts with the mistral-db-manage commands.
   To recover, open the psql shell and delete the new tables manually and rerun the
   mistral-db-manage commands. The following is a sample script to recover from the errors.

  .. sourcecode:: bash

     sudo service mistral-api stop
     sudo service mistral stop
     sudo -u postgres psql
     \connect mistral
     DROP TABLE event_triggers_v2;
     DROP TABLE workflow_executions_v2 CASCADE;
     DROP TABLE task_executions_v2;
     DROP TABLE action_executions_v2;
     DROP TABLE named_locks;
     \q

     /opt/stackstorm/mistral/bin/mistral-db-manage --config-file /etc/mistral/mistral.conf populate
     sudo service mistral start
     sudo service mistral-api start

v2.1
''''

* Datastore model migration - Scope names are now ``st2kv.system`` and ``st2kv.user`` as
  opposed to ``system`` and ``user``.

  .. code-block:: bash

     /opt/stackstorm/st2/bin/st2-migrate-datastore-scopes.py

* We are piloting pluggable runners (See :ref:`upgrade notes<upgrade_notes>`). Runners now
  have to be explicitly registered just like other content.

  .. code-block:: bash

     /opt/stackstorm/st2/bin/st2-migrate-runners.sh

* Service restart ``st2ctl restart`` and reload ``st2ctl reload`` are required after upgrade
  for the new pack management features to work properly. Some of the pack management actions
  and workflows have changed.


Content Roll-Over
-----------------

In some cases, you may need to roll over the automation from one instance of |st2| to another box
or deployment. To do this, provision a new |st2| instance, and roll over the content. Thanks to
the "Infrastructure as Code" approach, all |st2| content and artifacts are simple files, and
should be kept under source control.


1. Install |st2| ``VERSION_NEW`` on a brand new instance using packages based installer.
2. Package all your packs from the old ``VERSION_OLD`` instance and place them under some SCM
   like git (you should have done it long ago). Each pack must be in its own repo.
3. Save your key-value pairs from the st2 datastore: ``st2 key list -j > kv_file.json``
4. Grab packs from the SCM. If the SCM is git then you can directly install them with
   ``st2 pack install <repo-url>=<pack-list>>``
5. Reconfigure all external services to point to the new |st2| instance.
6. Load your keys to the datastore: ``st2 key load kv_file.json``. You might have to adjust the
   JSON files to include ``scope`` and ``secret`` if you are upgrading from a version < 1.5.
   See migration script in ``/opt/stackstorm/st2/bin/st2-migrate-datastore-to-include-scope-secret.py``.
7. Back up audit log from ``VERSION_OLD`` server found under ``/var/log/st2/*.audit.log`` and move
   to a safe location. Note that history of old executions will be lost during such a transition,
   but a full audit record is still available in the log files that were transferred over.

.. note::

    All information on this page refers to the config files in the
    ``/opt/stackstorm/configs/`` directory.

    ``config.yaml`` files inside the pack directory were deprecated in |st2|
    v1.5. As of version 2.4, pack registration will fail with ERROR logs if
    the pack contains ``config.yaml``.
    
    If you are still using ``config.yaml``, you **MUST** migrate to the new
    style.

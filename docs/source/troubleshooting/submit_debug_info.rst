Submitting Debugging Information 
================================

The first step to help debug and troubleshoot an issue for you is for us to try to
reproduce the problem by making sure our setup resemble yours as closely as possible.

To save time and make it convenient, |st2| includes a utility
which allows you to easily and securely send us the information we need to
help us debug or troubleshoot your issue.

By default, this utility sends us the following information:

* All the |st2| services log files from ``/var/log/st2``
* Mistral service log file from ``/var/log/mistral.log``
* |st2| and Mistral config file (``/etc/st2/st2.conf``,
  ``/etc/mistral/mistral.conf``). Prior to sending the config files we strip
  sensitive information such as database and queue access information.
* |st2| content (integration packs) minus the pack configs.

All this information is bundled up in a tarball and encrypted using our
public key via public-key cryptography. Once submitted, this bundled information
is only accessible to Brocade employees and it is used solely for
debugging purposes.

To send debug information to Brocade, run this CLI command:

.. sourcecode:: bash

    st2-submit-debug-info

    This will submit the following information to Brocade: logs, configs, content, system_info
    Are you sure you want to proceed? [y/n] y
    2015-02-10 16:43:54,733  INFO - Collecting files...
    2015-02-10 16:43:55,714  INFO - Creating tarball...

    2015-02-10 16:44:02,591  INFO - Debug tarball successfully uploaded to Brocade

By default, the command will run in an interactive mode. If you want to run it in a
non-interactive mode and assuming "yes" as the answer to all the questions, you
can use the ``--yes`` flag. For example:

.. sourcecode:: bash

    st2-submit-debug-info --yes

    2015-02-10 16:45:36,074  INFO - Collecting files...
    2015-02-10 16:45:36,988  INFO - Creating tarball...

    2015-02-10 16:45:43,926  INFO - Debug tarball successfully uploaded to StackStorm

If you want to only send specific information, or exclude particular information
you can use the ``--exclude-<content>`` flag. For example, to only send us the log files:

.. sourcecode:: bash

    st2-submit-debug-info --exclude-configs --exclude-content --exclude-system-info

Reviewing the Debug Information
-------------------------------

If you want to review and/or manipulate the information (e.g. remove log lines
which you might find sensitive), you can do that using the ``--review`` flag.

When this flag is used, the archive will not be encrypted and uploaded:

.. sourcecode:: bash

    st2-submit-debug-info --review

    2015-02-10 17:43:49,016  INFO - Collecting files...
    2015-02-10 17:43:49,770  INFO - Creating tarball...
    2015-02-10 17:43:49,912  INFO - Debug tarball successfully generated and can be reviewed at: /tmp/st2-debug-output-vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-64-2015-02-10-174349.tar.gz

By default, the archive will be written to the ``/tmp`` directory. This can be controlled by using
the ``--output`` option to specify the location/filename of the archive:

.. sourcecode:: bash

    st2-submit-debug-info --review --output my-st2-debug-file.tar.gz

    2016-02-24 23:53:25,779  INFO - Collecting files...
    2016-02-24 23:53:26,423  INFO - Creating tarball...
    2016-02-24 23:53:26,526  INFO - Debug tarball successfully generated and can be reviewed at: my-st2-debug-file.tar.gz

After review, the archive can be uploaded using the ``--existing-file`` option:

.. sourcecode:: bash

    st2-submit-debug-info --config /etc/st2debug/submit-debug-info.yaml --existing-file my-st2-debug-file.tar.gz

    2016-02-24 23:56:13,019  INFO - Encrypting tarball...
    2016-02-24 23:56:13,814  INFO - Debug tarball successfully uploaded to Brocade (name=my-st2-debug-file.tar.gz.asc)
    2016-02-24 23:56:13,814  INFO - When communicating with support, please let them know the tarball name - my-st2-debug-file.tar.gz.asc


Customizing the Debug Information Gathered
------------------------------------------

``st2-submit-debug-info`` can be customized for specific deployments by loading a set of overrides
from a YAML file. The following config options are supported:

* ``log_file_paths`` - an additional set of log files to gather
* ``st2_config_file_path`` - path to st2.conf
* ``mistral_config_file_path`` - path to mistral.conf
* ``s3_bucket_url`` - the S3 bucket to upload the archive to
* ``gpg_key_fingerprint`` - gpg fingerprint to use when encrypting the archive
* ``gpg_key`` - gpg key to use when encrypting the archive
* ``shell_commands`` - a list of shell commands to execute and capture the output from
* ``company_name`` - the company name to show in the interactive prompts and log messages

Sample config yaml file:

.. literalinclude:: __debug_info_config.yaml
   :language: yaml

To send debug information, simply invoke the CLI command shown below passing it the path to
the YAML config file:

.. sourcecode:: bash

    st2-submit-debug-info --config <path to config file>

    This will submit the following information to Brocade: logs, configs, content, system_info, shell_commands

We can pass through any command line arguments provided to ``st2-submit-debug-info``.

For example:

* To run it in a non-interactive mode use the '--yes' option:

  .. sourcecode:: bash

    st2-submit-debug-info --yes --config <path to config file>

    2016-01-19 06:25:09,024  INFO - Collecting files...

* To send specific information or to exclude particular information, use the
  ``--exclude-<content>`` flag:

  .. sourcecode:: bash

    st2-submit-debug-info --exclude-shell-commands --config <path to config file>

    This will submit the following information to Brocade: logs, configs, content, system_info

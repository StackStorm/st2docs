  excuse to become one! Come hang out, chat to us, search the archives to see if anyone else has
  faced the same problem. Register `here <https://stackstorm.com/community-signup>`_.
* `IRC <http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=stackstorm/>`_: We can all get our geek fix!

Please have the following list ready so we can help you faster:

1. st2 version. (``st2 --version``)
2. st2client version. (``pip show st2client``)
3. OS version. (e.g. CentOS 7. ``uname -a``)
4. Python version. (``python --version``)
5. A brief description of the problem.
6. Any relevant logs you have collected. We recommend using `Pastebin <http://pastebin.com/>`_
   or `github gists <http://gist.github.com/>`_. Makes it much easier to read logfiles.

You can also use the ``st2-submit-debug-info`` tool (See :ref:`submit_debug_info_to_st2`).

If you are sure there is a st2 bug after your research, file an `issue

reproduce the bug on our end. The more information you provide us, the faster we can resolve your
issue.

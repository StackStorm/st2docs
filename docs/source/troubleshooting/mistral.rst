Mistral Issues
==============

This section contains information on how to troubleshoot Mistral-related issues.

Troubleshooting Mistral Database Upgrade
----------------------------------------

The ``mistral`` and ``mistral-api`` services must not be running at time of upgrading the st2mistral
package and the Mistral database schema. If the st2mistral package has been upgraded and the
services are started before the ``mistral-db-manage upgrade head`` CLI command is executed, then the
``mistral-db-manage upgrade head`` command may fail. 

When the ``mistral`` and ``mistral-api`` services run, SQLAlchemy automatically creates tables,
relationships, and indices that do not exist. If there are new database objects in the upgraded
database schema, the ``mistral-db-manage upgrade head`` command will fail because the actual schema
in the database is now different than its specifications, and it no longer can create the new database
objects. 

When that happens, the new database tables, relationships, and indices must be deleted before the
``mistral-db-manage upgrade head`` command can be re-run. For more details, review the version-specific
notes in the :doc:`/install/upgrades` documentation, for the version of Mistral and |st2| you are upgrading
too.

Troubleshooting Mistral Workflow Completion Latency
---------------------------------------------------

|st2| interacts with Mistral via HTTP APIs. This interaction occurs when kicking off a workflow execution
or collecting the results for a running workflow. |st2| queries Mistral to check on the workflow
execution status and the status of individual tasks.

The process in |st2| that does the querying is called ``st2resultstracker``. This process saves the state
of outstanding workflow executions in the database, and once a workflow is complete, deletes the
state from the database. The process uses eventlets to simultaneously query multiple workflow
results. This can consume significant CPU cycles. 

As of |st2| v2.3 onwards, there are two configurable values for controlling this from happening. These are
``thread_pool_size`` (number of eventlets) and ``query_interval`` (interval to space out the
subsequent queries to Mistral for a single execution). You can configure these values by editing
the ``results_tracker`` section in ``/etc/st2/st2.conf``:

.. sourcecode:: ini

    [resultstracker]
    query_interval = 5 # in seconds
    thread_pool_size = 10

These values are subject to load conditions in your infrastructure and the number of workflows
you are running. The default value for ``query_interval`` is set to ``5`` (seconds) which is a balance
between the workflow speed and the CPU overhead. With |st2| 2.2 and
earlier, this value was ``0.1``. We have now set the default value to ``5`` seconds to be
conservative. This also means the time to detect a completed workflow in Mistral by |st2| could
take as long as 5 seconds.

If this is unacceptable for you, you can reduce the ``query_interval`` and also
simultaneously check CPU usage for the ``st2resultstracker`` process.

We are reworking the design to use HTTP callbacks from Mistral to |st2|. Until then, these tunable
knobs should help.
